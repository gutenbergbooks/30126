<p class="first"><span>The</span> following pages have grown out of a paper,
following the same outline more briefly, which
was read before the Pastors&#8217; Conference of the
San Juaquin Valley Baptist Association, the largest
association in the Northern California Baptist Convention.
At the close of the reading a request for
its publication was enthusiastically and unanimously
voted.</p>

<p>The author has since divided the paper into two
chapters; in the first chapter has added to and classified
the quotations concerning evolution, has enlarged
the remarks on the influence of evolution on Scripture
doctrine, and has both enlarged upon and entirely
rearranged the matter of the second chapter, in an
attempt to make it both more obvious and more conclusive
to the reader than it was felt to be to the
hearers.</p>

<p>The term &#8220;Church&#8221; in the following pages is intended
to cover that fellowship, of every name, which
includes all who have been really born again. When
organized church fellowship is referred to, the whole
evangelical Protestant fellowship in general is meant,
as distinguished from Roman Catholic, Greek church,
or any other non-evangelical faith, although true Christians
are to be found within every fellowship. The
term &#8220;Schools,&#8221; in its larger meaning, includes all
institutions of learning maintained at private, denominational,
or public expense; more specifically,
<span class="pgbrk"><a name="png.004" id="png.004"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">4</span><span class="ns">]</span></span>
those dominated by the present evolutionary philosophy
are meant. With notable exceptions in a few
schools that refuse to be so dominated, the whole educational
system in general, especially in the Northern
States, has practically capitulated to the evolutionists,
and the schools that have so surrendered are
particularly in mind in the following discussion.</p>

<p>It is but a humble effort to point out what is obviously
the only possible solution for the present distressing
and destructive controversy between the
Church and the Schools, but the author fondly hopes
that it will prove to be a real, even though small, contribution
toward the ending of that controversy.</p>

<p>It is sent out with the prayer that He who is Truth
incarnate may lead those in both the Church and the
Schools who really want to know the truth at all cost
to a common attitude toward Himself, to a common,
because truly scientific, method of investigating truth
in both the natural and the spiritual realms, and therefore
to a common goal which will unite them against
all those forces that seek to capture both the Church
and the Schools for the enemy.</p>

The Present Controversy&mdash;the Cause</h3>

<p class="first"><span>It</span> must be so self-evident as to be axiomatic that
there are two distinct realms in God's universe.
One is the realm that contains the Creator, and the
other that which contains His creation. Of course, if
we are pantheists, we will not admit that classification;
but those who believe and accept the Word of
God are not pantheists.</p>

<p>It is inevitable, therefore, that the facts, the verities,
the truths of the universe should be classified according
to their realms; those having to do with the Person
and relationships of the Creator being separable into
one realm, and those having to do with His creation
into another.</p>

<p>That this classification is universally recognized, is
a matter of common knowledge. That class of truth
which has to do with God we call supernatural, or
spiritual, truth, and that which relates to His creation
we call natural, or scientific, truth.</p>

<p>It is precisely because of this classification that there
are two separate institutions in the world, each of
which is working in one of these realms. The <b>Church</b>
accepts it as her function to receive and propagate
spiritual truth, as God has revealed Himself in His
character; while the <b>Schools</b> accept it as their function
<span class="pgbrk"><a name="png.008" id="png.008"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">8</span><span class="ns">]</span></span>
to study and teach scientific truth, as God has revealed
Himself in His works. This is the entire logic
of the existence in the world of these two separate
institutions, both of which are engaged in the investigation
and propagation of truth.</p>

<p>But although the Church and the Schools are entirely
separate institutions, and although they are
engaged, one in the spread of spiritual truth and the
other in the diffusion of scientific truth, yet <b>truth is
an eternal unity</b>. This must be so, in the nature of
things, for all truth proceeds from and reveals the
one and only God Who is its Source and of Whom it
is the consistent and perfect expression.</p>

<p>Conflict between these two realms of truth is, therefore,
eternally impossible. Men talk of a conflict between
science and the Bible, but no such conflict exists.
If there is any contradiction, it is not between the
statements of Scripture and the facts of science, but
between the false interpretations of Scripture and the
immature conclusions of science. Herbert Spencer was
right when he said:
<span class="bquote">It is incredible that there should be two orders
of truth in absolute and everlasting opposition.</span></p>

<p>Not until God begins to contradict Himself will these
two realms of truth ever be in conflict with each other.</p>

<p>The Church and the Schools, then, can never be in
conflict until some abnormal condition creeps into the
one or the other; for, although working in different
realms of truth, each is yet receiving revelations of
the one God who can never be in conflict with Himself.</p>

<p>When these two institutions are in normal condition,
each will not only not destroy the work of the
<span class="pgbrk"><a name="png.009" id="png.009"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">9</span><span class="ns">]</span></span>
other, but each will make every possible contribution
to the success of the other, and antagonism between
them will be impossible. When conflict occurs, therefore,
it is because the teachers in one realm or in both
have not arrived at the truth in their respective realms.</p>

<p>And so when the Church denies the <b>facts</b>&mdash;not the
unproven theories, notice, but the clearly demonstrated
<b>facts</b>&mdash;of science, something is wrong with the Church.
And when the Schools put forth <b>theories</b> that undermine
the very foundations of the Church and her work,
there is something wrong with the Schools.</p>

<p>Now it is no secret that the Church and the Schools,
broadly speaking, are in serious conflict with each
other today. Where lies the cause? If the Church
is denying and fighting the demonstrated <b>facts</b> of
science, then the Church is clearly at fault and ought
to get right at once.</p>

<p>But this is not so, for the conflict is altogether over
unproven theories, and has nothing to do with demonstrated
scientific facts. And so this takes us at once
and completely out of the realm of science and lands
us in that of speculative philosophy&mdash;a fact that shows
how unreasonable and even foolish the conflict is. For
the thing that has set the Church and the Schools
into battle array against each other is that speculative
guess concerning origins called the <b>Theory of Evolution</b>.
This lies at the heart of the opposition that each
of these great institutions feels toward the other.</p>

<p>It is true that a certain amount of the trouble arises
from misunderstanding, because the term &#8220;evolution&#8221;
is used in so many loose, illogical, and unscientific
ways; but back of all misuse of the term there is a
fundamental cause on which this antagonism rests, and
<span class="pgbrk"><a name="png.010" id="png.010"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">10</span><span class="ns">]</span></span>
that cause is found in the nature of the theory and
its effects on those who consistently believe it.</p>

<p>The technical meaning of the term may be said to
be a structural change in the direction of development
into higher forms of existence, brought about by
internal force without external aid.</p>

<p>There is also a scientific classification of the subject,
into sub-organic, organic, and super-organic evolution.
Sub-organic evolution applies to the development
of non-living matter; organic, to the development
of vegetable and animal life; and super-organic, to
the development of intellectual, moral, and spiritual
life. But while the subject is thus classified for convenience,
it is all one doctrine, and is meant to describe
one process of development from the non-living
realm to the spiritual.</p>

<p>There is also one theory which is called causal, and
another which is called modal, evolution. According
to the former, evolution is the first cause of all life,
which, of course, excludes God as the First Cause;
and according to the latter, evolution is the mode, or
method, used by God in creation.</p>

<p>Now, the Church has vital reasons for fighting this
philosophical guess. One reason is, that it is entirely
unsupported by <b>facts</b>, and is therefore altogether unproven.
But if this were the only reason, the Church
could be convicted of the supreme folly of her entire
history, for turning aside to fight an unproven guess.
A more vital reason is that the theory does not stop
with the natural realm, but goes right on up into the
realm of spiritual truth, and assumes to pronounce on
the most vital spiritual realities in such a way that
the logic of the theory, if consistently accepted, utterly
<span class="pgbrk"><a name="png.011" id="png.011"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">11</span><span class="ns">]</span></span>
destroys both the foundations of the Church and the
content of the Gospel. Indeed, evolution has been proclaimed
to the world as the ally of a philosophy which
boasts of its capacity to drive Christianity out of
existence.</p>

<p>For the Church, therefore, to fail to fight a theory
that strikes at her very vitals would be to become a
traitor to the Lord who bought her and sent her into
the world to preach His gospel. And so she is compelled
to choose between submitting to an unproven
and destructive theory, which has never saved <b>any</b>
one who has believed it, and preaching the gospel of
God's grace, which has infallibly saved <b>every</b> one
who has believed it. The true Church is fighting the
theory of evolution in order that the message she is
commissioned to preach may not be rendered of <a name="tn1" id="tn1"></a><ins class="transcriber" title="changed from &#8220;none&#8221;">no</ins>
effect by a non-belligerent attitude toward it being
mistaken for approval of it.</p>

<p>Not only the fact that the theory is entirely unproven,
but also and more particularly the nature of
its influence on faith in the Bible compels the Church
to reckon with it. We will go into these two reasons
for antagonizing this speculative guess.</p>

<h4 class="s1"><a name="ref.I.I" id="ref.I.I"></a>I. The Theory of Evolution is Unproven.</h4>

<p>The reason we reflect on this for a few moments lies
in what has already been said. If evolution is a fact,
then for the Church to refuse it and fight against it
would be to fight against God, which ought to bring
her to swift judgment for her mad folly. But if it is
only an unproven theory, then she is justified if she
has good reasons for fighting its propagation. We will
therefore note what the scientists themselves have to
say regarding the theory.</p>

<h4 class="s2"><span class="pgbrk"><a name="png.012" id="png.012"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">12</span><span class="ns">]</span></span>
<a name="ref.I.I.1" id="ref.I.I.1"></a><b>1.</b> Testimony <b>for</b> Evolution.</h4>

<p>There are teachers of science who do not hesitate to
assure us that the doctrine of evolution is now no
longer a theory but an assured fact. A few representative
quotations from that class will suffice.</p>

<p>Dr. P. C. Mitchell says, in a late edition of the &#8220;Encyclopedia
Britannica&#8221;:
<span class="bquote">The vast bulk of botanical and biological work
on living and extinct forms published during the
last quarter of the nineteenth century increased
almost beyond all expectation the evidence for the
<b>fact</b> of evolution.</span></p>

<p>Prof. S. C. Schmucker, of the West Chester, Pennsylvania,
State Normal School, in his book, &#8220;The Meaning
of Evolution,&#8221; says:
<span class="bquote">Among students of animals and plants there is
no longer any question as to the <b>truth</b> of evolution.
That the animals of the present are the
altered animals of the past, that the plants of
today are the modified plants of yesterday, that
civilized man of today is the savage of yesterday
and the tree dweller of the day before, is no longer
debatable to the mass of biologists.</span></p>

<p>Professor Fish, then of Denison University, Granville,
Ohio, not long ago dictated to his class, of which
the writer&#8217;s daughter was a member, the following
statement:
<span class="bquote">Organic evolution is the key to all biological
thinking of today. It is not a <b>theory</b> but a <b>fact</b>,
because the main facts are true. Man is the off-spring
of the lower animals, and the ancestry can
be traced back to the simplest forms of animals
known. All medical research takes that fact into
account.</span></p>

<p><span class="pgbrk"><a name="png.013" id="png.013"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">13</span><span class="ns">]</span></span>Prof. S. W. Williston, department of paleontology,
University of Chicago, says:
<span class="bquote">I know of no biologist, whether of high or low
degree, master or tyro, who ventures to suggest
a doubt as to the fundamental truths of organic
evolution.</span></p>

<p>Prof. William Patten, department of biology and
zoology, Dartmouth College, says:
<span class="bquote">Evolution is the accepted doctrine of the natural
sciences to the extent that it has long ceased to
be a subject of debate in standard scientific journals
or in organized conferences of men of science.</span></p>

<p>Prof. Charles B. Davenport, department of experimental
evolution, Carnegie Institute, Washington, D. C.,
says:
<span class="bquote">I do not know of a single modern scientific man
who does not believe in evolution.</span></p>

<p>And Prof. Frank R. Lillie, department of embryology,
University of Chicago, says:
<span class="bquote">I feel pretty impatient over the statements of
certain religious teachers that evolution has collapsed.</span></p>

<p>These statements are sufficiently representative to
indicate the attitude toward the theory of evolution
of a great section of the scientific world today, including
many science teachers in schools founded and
endowed by the Church for the giving of Christian
education.</p>

<p>But it is not true that the theory is universally
accepted or even scientifically proved to be a fact.

Let a few scientists of at least equal eminence with
those quoted above bear their testimony.</p>

<h4 class="s2"><a name="ref.I.I.2" id="ref.I.I.2"></a><b>2.</b> Testimony <b>Against</b> Evolution.</h4>

<p>But before we quote this testimony it may be well
to pause a moment for a little information that may
make it more intelligible to us.</p>

<p>The so-called proofs of evolution are derived from
both the biological and the geological realms of natural
science.</p>

<p class="s3"><a name="ref.I.I.2.a" id="ref.I.I.2.a"></a><b>a.</b> We will consider, first, the so-called proofs
taken from the <b>biological</b> realm.</p>

<p>Darwin&#8217;s theory was arrived at from data taken
from the biological realm, and consists of two doctrines.
One is the doctrine of <b>natural selection</b>, which
was his own personal contribution to the discussion,
and the other is that of <b>the inheritance of acquired
characters</b>, which he borrowed from Lamarck. The
former is the doctrine meant when pure Darwinism
is referred to.</p>

<p class="section"><a name="ref.I.I.2.a.i" id="ref.I.I.2.a.i"></a><b>(i).</b> The Doctrine of Natural Selection.</p>

<p>Darwin himself said:
<span class="bquote">We cannot prove that a single species has
changed,</span>
and, also,
<span class="bquote">Many of the objections to the hypothesis of
evolution are so serious I can hardly reflect on
them without being staggered.</span></p>

<p><span class="pgbrk"><a name="png.015" id="png.015"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">15</span><span class="ns">]</span></span>
Dr. N. S. Shaler, department of geology, Harvard,
says:
<span class="bquote">It begins to be evident that the Darwinian
hypothesis is still essentially unverified....
It is not yet proven that a single species of the
two or three million now inhabiting the earth had
been established solely or mainly by the operation
of natural selection.</span></p>

<p>Professor Fleischmann, of Erlangen, has said:
<span class="bquote">The Darwinian theory of descent has in the
realms of nature not a single fact to confirm it.
It is not the result of scientific research, but purely
the product of the imagination.</span></p>

<p>And John Burroughs, although an evolutionist up
to his recent death, said of Darwin, in the August,
1920, &#8220;Atlantic Monthly&#8221;:
<span class="bquote">He has already been as completely shorn of his
selection doctrines as Samson was shorn of his
locks.</span></p>

<p>If these statements from scientific men mean anything
at all, they mean, at least, that pure Darwinism
is altogether unproven, if not that it is dead.</p>

<p class="section"><a name="ref.I.I.2.a.ii" id="ref.I.I.2.a.ii"></a><b>(ii).</b> The Doctrine of Acquired Characters.</p>

<p>Spencer made this doctrine the fundamental one in
his evolutionary philosophy. Its importance was so
vital to him that he said:
<span class="bquote">Close contemplation of the facts impresses me
more strongly than ever with the two alternatives&mdash;either
there has been inheritance of acquired
characters, or there has been no evolution.</span></p>

<p><span class="pgbrk"><a name="png.016" id="png.016"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">16</span><span class="ns">]</span></span>
It is of great interest, therefore, to note what competent
scientists have said about this doctrine.</p>

<p>Dr. Thomas Hunt Morgan, department of science,
Columbia University, says:
<span class="bquote">Today the theory has few followers among
trained investigators, but it still has a popular
vogue that is wide-spread and vociferous.</span></p>

<p>Alfred Russell Wallace, in his &#8220;Autobiography,&#8221;
said:
<span class="bquote">All the available evidence is opposed to the
doctrine of acquired characters.</span></p>

<p>Prof. William Bateson, in his 1914 Presidential Address
before the British Association for the Advancement
of Science, said:
<span class="bquote">We have done with the notion that Darwin
came latterly to favor, that large differences can
arise by the accumulation of small differences.</span></p>

<p>He also remarks that the new knowledge of heredity
shows that whatever evolution there is occurs by loss
of factors and not by gain, and that in this way the
progress of science is
<span class="bquote">destroying much that till lately passed for gospel.</span></p>

<p>And commenting on these remarks of Bateson, Prof.
S. C. Holmes, of the University of California, says they
are
<span class="bquote">an illustration of the bankruptcy of the present
evolutionary theory.</span></p>

<p>Then Prof. George McCready Price, department of
geology, Pacific Union College, Helena, California, has
said very recently:
<span class="pgbrk"><a name="png.017" id="png.017"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">17</span><span class="ns">]</span></span>
<span class="bquote">It has long since been definitely settled that
acquired characters are not transmitted in heredity.</span></p>

<p>And in another place he exclaims:
<span class="bquote">If cells did not maintain their ancestral character
in a very remarkable way, what would be
the use of grafting a good kind of fruit on to a
stock of poorer quality? The very permanency
of the graft thus produced is proof of the persistency
with which the cells reproduce only "after
their kind."</span></p>

<p>Then in speaking of Mendel&#8217;s discoveries in the realm
of heredity, and which have now become scientifically
demonstrated laws, he says that
<span class="bquote">the whole foundation of biological evolution has
been completely undermined by these new discoveries.</span></p>

<p>And he sums up the conclusions to which present-day
scientists are coming, in the words:
<span class="bquote">The principles of heredity, as now understood,
have brought us back to that great truth which
is given in the first chapter of our Bible, that
each form of plant or animal was designed by
the Creator to reproduce only "after its kind."</span></p>

<p>The one who accepts this testimony, therefore, is
compelled to conclude that the doctrine of acquired
characters is also dead.</p>

<p class="section"><a name="ref.I.I.2.a.iii" id="ref.I.I.2.a.iii"></a><b>(iii).</b> The Biogenetic &#8220;Law.&#8221;</p>

<p>In addition to the two forms of the theory above
noted, Haeckel added emphasis to these so-called biological
proofs by putting forth a doctrine that came
<span class="pgbrk"><a name="png.018" id="png.018"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">18</span><span class="ns">]</span></span>
to be called the biogenetic &#8220;law,&#8221; even though it was
nothing but a hypothesis. It was called the recapitulation
theory, because it was imagined that the developing
human embryo recapitulates or passes
through successive stages of the more mature forms
of some of the lower animals.</p>

<p>Concerning this theory Dr. A. Weber, University
of Geneva, Switzerland, said in the &#8220;Scientific American
Monthly&#8221; for February, 1921:
<span class="bquote">The critical comments of such men as O. Hertwig,
Kiebel, and Vialleton, indeed, have practically
torn to shreds the aforesaid fundamental biogenetic
law. Its almost universal abandonment has
left considerably at a loss those investigators who
sought in the structures of organisms the key to
their remote origins or to their relationships.</span></p>

<p>So it would seem that if this form of the theory is
utterly destitute of proof, the whole biological foundation
of the theory is gone.</p>

<p>It is perfectly in harmony with scientific testimony,
therefore, that Professor Price says concerning this
phase of the theory:
<span class="bquote">The science of twenty or thirty years ago was
in high glee at the thought of having almost proved
the theory of biological evolution. Today, for
every careful, candid inquirer, these hopes are
crushed; and with weary, reluctant sadness does
modern biology now confess that the Church has
probably been right all the time.</span></p>

<p>If these men have borne faithful testimony to the
situation as it now exists in the biological realm, the
only conclusion possible is that the borrowed portion
of Darwin&#8217;s theory has also utterly collapsed.</p>

<p><span class="pgbrk"><a name="png.019" id="png.019"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">19</span><span class="ns">]</span></span>
It is passing strange, in view of these facts, that
competent and scholarly men of science should still
cling to a theory so utterly discredited by eminent
scientists. Is it because they are determined to believe
in evolution in spite of such evidence to the contrary,
or is it because there is still left a foundation
for the doctrine lying back of all this which has not
yet been disturbed, even though &#8220;the biological clues
have all run out,&#8221; as Professor Price says they have?</p>

<p>The supposed evidence of geology, with its theories
of uniformity and successive ages, forms precisely
such a foundation.</p>

<p class="s3"><a name="ref.I.I.2.b" id="ref.I.I.2.b"></a><b>b.</b> We will consider, therefore, in the next place, the
so-called proofs taken from the <b>geological</b> realm.</p>

<p>Dr. T. H. Morgan, who was quoted above as against
the theory of the inheritance of acquired characters,
rests his faith in the theory of evolution on a geological
foundation. He says:
<span class="bquote">The direct evidence furnished by fossil remains
is by all odds the strongest evidence we have in
favor of organic evolution.</span></p>

<p>Has present-day science anything to say about this?
In spite of the collapse of the supposed biological
proofs, are there any tangible and scientifically established
proofs in the geological realm?</p>

<p>Professor Price, who, as noted above, is a geologist,
and therefore speaks according to first-hand knowledge,
shows that fossil remains are deposited over
many thousands of square miles in widely separated
sections of the earth, not only in the opposite order
from that required to prove the theory of evolution,
<span class="pgbrk"><a name="png.020" id="png.020"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">20</span><span class="ns">]</span></span>
but in a great variety of orders, demonstrating, as
he says, that they cannot be arranged off into ages,
but that they simply indicate different forms of life
that existed side by side. He then exclaims:
<span class="bquote"><b>How much of the earth's crust would we have
to find</b> in this upside down order of the fossils,
before we would be convinced that there must be
something hopelessly wrong with the theory of
Successive Ages which drives otherwise competent
observers to throw away their common sense and
cling desperately to a fantastic theory in the very
teeth of such facts?</span></p>

<p>Then he tells us that
<span class="bquote">the theory of Successive Ages, with the forms of
life appearing on earth in a precise and invariable
order, is dead for all coming time for every man
who has had a chance to examine the evidence and
has enough training in logic and scientific methods
to know when a thing is really proved.</span></p>

<p>And he concludes that the work of strict inductive
science has destroyed this &#8220;fantastic scheme&#8221; forever,
<span class="bquote">and thus <b>leaves the way open</b> to say that life
must have originated by just such a literal creation
as is recorded in the first chapters of the
Bible.</span></p>

<p>If these statements have any meaning at all, they
can mean only that the geological foundation for the
theory of evolution has also collapsed.</p>

<p class="s3"><a name="ref.I.I.2.c" id="ref.I.I.2.c"></a><b>c.</b> It remains for us to listen to the testimony of a<br />
few more men of science concerning the<br />
<b>whole theory</b> of evolution in general.</p>

<p><span class="pgbrk"><a name="png.021" id="png.021"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">21</span><span class="ns">]</span></span>
Professor Virchow, the greatest German authority
on physiology, and once a strong advocate of the
theory, has said:
<span class="bquote">It is all nonsense. It cannot be proved by
science that man descends from the ape or from
any other animal. Since the announcement of the
theory, all real scientific knowledge has proceeded
in the opposite direction.</span></p>

<p>Professor Tyndall, in an article in the &#8220;Fortnightly
Review,&#8221; said:
<span class="bquote">There ought to be a clear distinction made between
science in a state of hypothesis and science
in a state of fact. And inasmuch as it is still in
its hypothetical stage, the ban of exclusion ought
to fall upon the theory of evolution. I agree
with Virchow that the proofs of it are still wanting,
that the failures have been lamentable, and
that the doctrine has been utterly discredited.</span></p>

<p>Prof. L. S. Beal, physiologist and professor of anatomy
in King's College, London, says:
<span class="bquote">The idea of any relation having been established
between the non-living and the living by a gradual
advance from lifeless matter to the lowest forms
of life, and so onward to the higher and more
complex, has not the slightest evidence from the
facts of any section of living nature of which
anything is known.</span></p>

<p>Professor Zoeckler, of the University of Greifswald,
says:
<span class="bquote">The claim that the hypothesis of descent is
scientifically secured must most decidedly be
denied.</span></p>

<p><span class="pgbrk"><a name="png.022" id="png.022"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">22</span><span class="ns">]</span></span>
DeCyon, the Russian scientist, says:
<span class="bquote">Evolution is pure assumption.</span></p>

<p>Prof. George McCready Price says:
<span class="bquote">In almost every one of the separate sciences
the arguments upon which the theory of evolution
gained its popularity a generation or so ago are
now known by the various specialists to have been
blunders, or mistakes, or hasty conclusions of one
kind or another.</span></p>

<p>And Sir J. William Dawson says:
<span class="bquote">"The evolution doctrine itself is one of the strangest
phenomena of humanity." It is "a system
destitute of any shadow of proof, and supported
merely by vague analogies and figures of speech,
and by the arbitrary and artificial coherence of
its parts." And he concludes that it is "surpassingly
strange" that such a theory should find
adherents.</span></p>

<p>To this list might be added such names as those of
Professor Henslow, former President of the British
Association; Prof. C. C. Everett, of Harvard; Dr. E.
Dennert; Dr. Goette; Prof. Edward Hoppe, the &#8220;Hamburg Savant&#8221;;
Professor Paulson, of Berlin; Professor
Rutemeyer, of Basel; and Prof. Max Wundt, of
Leipsic.</p>

<p>After all this contrary testimony on the part of
such unquestioned authorities, we are forced to conclude
not only that the testimony for evolution is far
from unanimous, but also that the theory is altogether
unproven, and that it is therefore utterly unscientific
to teach it as a fact, especially when those who do so
furnish us with no direct evidence whatever.</p>

So long, therefore, as there is an unbridged gulf
in the sub-organic realm between nothing and matter,
in the organic realm between the non-living and the
living, and in the super-organic realm between animals
and man, the Church cannot be blamed for being
scientific enough to refuse to accept such an unproven
and discredited theory, at least until a few <b>facts</b> are
forthcoming. Until then we must conclude that all
the proofs the scientists can furnish rest altogether
on inferences and assumptions.</p>

<p>When evolutionists can produce <b>matter</b> from nothing
or increase <b>energy</b> by any natural means known
to man, or bring forth the <b>living</b> from the non-living,
or bring into existence even one new and distinct
<b>species</b>, then they will be in a position to compel the
Church to listen to proofs; but until then the Church
is forced to reject evolution.</p>

<p>The most serious aspect of the controversy, however,
lies in the second objection mentioned above.</p>

<p>It is destructive of all the fundamental doctrines

<p>Over and again in the early verses of Genesis we
are told that God created the various species to reproduce
<b>after their kind</b>. But evolution says that
this is not true, for as a matter of fact, the various
species have continuously evolved from one to another
all the way to man.</p>

<p><span class="pgbrk"><a name="png.024" id="png.024"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">24</span><span class="ns">]</span></span>To a mind that is working normally, these two
propositions are mutually exclusive. And so those
who retain their intellectual integrity and consistency,
and who therefore cannot accept two contradictory
propositions at the same time, are compelled to <b>make
a choice</b> between them.</p>

<p>Huxley saw this when he said:
<span class="bquote">The doctrine of evolution is directly antagonistic
to that of creation. Evolution, if consistently accepted,
makes it impossible to believe the Bible.</span></p>

<p>When Professor Schmucker; therefore, speaks of the
creation story as
<span class="bquote">the poetical account of Genesis;</span>
when Dr. S. B. Meeser, of Crozer Theological Seminary,
describes the Scriptures as
<span class="bquote">the survivals of the fittest of those communion
experiences which men, who have lived intensely
in the moral interest, have had with God;</span>
when Dr. H. C. Vedder, of the same seminary, says
the Scriptures
<span class="bquote">"grew in ... accuracy" as they were written;</span>
when Dr. W. H. P. Faunce, President of Brown University,
can say:
<span class="bquote">Mr. Gladstone's last book is called "The Impregnable
Rock of Holy Scripture." The very
title shows a conception of the Bible at the farthest
removed from the present Biblical scholarship, to
which the Bible is a growth, not a rock;</span>
<span class="pgbrk"><a name="png.025" id="png.025"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">25</span><span class="ns">]</span></span>
when Dr. Ernest D. Burton, of the University of Chicago,
says:
<span class="bquote">Some among us have been constrained to admit
that the books [of the Bible] are not infallible in
history or in matters of science, and not wholly
consistent and therefore not ultimately and as a
whole inerrant in the field of morals and religion;</span>
and when Dr. Shailer Mathews, of the same University,
urges us to think the gospel
<span class="bquote">in terms of evolution,</span>
and then shows us what that means to him when he
says:
<span class="bquote">For in the New Testament there are conceptions
which the modern world under the dominance
of science [at the heart of which lies the
evolutionary philosophy] finds it impossible to
understand, much less to believe;</span>
these men are simply demonstrating the fact that they
still retain their intellectual integrity and consistency,
and that they are therefore entirely unable to accept
the doctrine of evolution and believe in an inerrant
Bible at the same time. That is, the logic of the doctrine
of evolution destroys for them the faith that,
in its original manuscripts, the Bible as it came from
God to man was "truth unmixed with error," with
the resulting confidence that He who gave it has preserved
it to us by His providence essentially as it
was given.</p>

<p>This means that these men and all who agree with
them have rejected that Word which is forever settled
in heaven, in order to accept a hypothesis which
<span class="pgbrk"><a name="png.026" id="png.026"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">26</span><span class="ns">]</span></span>
is never settled on earth; that they have given up the
Book which has stood unchanged through the centuries
against every conceivable form of assault, and
taken in its place a set of scientific speculations that
have either to be revised or discarded for new speculations
every few years; that they have turned from
an inspired, inerrant and authoritative revelation of
God, and turned to an unproven theory which makes
the Bible a human document, of supreme value, so
they say, as unfolding the religious evolution of the
race, but full of errors because of the human element
in it.</p>

<p>The result of this is the so-called &#8220;scientific&#8221; or
&#8220;historical&#8221; method of interpreting the Bible, which
means, to quote Dr. Meeser, that while the Scriptures
<span class="bquote">have the wisdom of experts in religion, [yet]
"authority" is scarcely the term to describe their
value, and may, when applied to them, obscure
their real character.</span></p>

<p>&#8220;But why make all this ado about it,&#8221; say the evolutionists;
&#8220;it is all simply a question of interpretation.&#8221;</p>

<p>That is absolutely right. It is the interpretation of
the evolutionists set in opposition to that of the Holy
Spirit; and the true Church, compelled to make a
choice, takes that of the Holy Spirit.</p>

<h4 class="s2"><a name="ref.I.II.2" id="ref.I.II.2"></a><b>2.</b> The logic of evolution destroys the doctrine of
the <i>fall of man</i> and its result in total depravity.
After an address somewhat along these lines in one
of the largest normal schools in the world, the science
professor said to the writer, &#8220;Yes, but you know there
is evolution and <i>evolution</i>.&#8221;</h4>

<p><span class="pgbrk"><a name="png.027" id="png.027"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">27</span><span class="ns">]</span></span>
That is indeed true. We are all aware of the fact
that there are various kinds, shapes, and colors of
evolution, from theistic to atheistic; but the fact still
remains that <b>every</b> theory is <b>still evolution</b>, and that
<b>any</b> theory of evolution whatsoever, if it means anything
at all, means steady <b>progress</b> from lower to
higher. Progress is certainly the one thought that
is vital to any definition of evolution, and progress
<b>downward</b> is excluded by the very meaning of the
word, and so evolution under <b>any</b> theory can mean
nothing but progress <b>upward</b>.</p>

<p>But the Word of God says that man has gone <b>down</b>
from a condition of purity and innocence into a condition
of such sinful enmity against God, that he is
not only not subject to the law of God, but is utterly
incapable of bringing himself into subjection to it.
And the experience of every Christian gives sorrowful
but certain evidence to that fact.</p>

<p>This condition the Bible describes as being <b>dead</b>
in sin. And since death is not death at all until it
is total, man, therefore, being dead, is totally dead&mdash;and
this is total depravity.</p>

<p>This means that the only progress possible to man
in his natural state is <b>progress in corruption</b>. For
total depravity, which is total spiritual death, does
not mean that the last limit of corruption has been
reached, but that while death is total, corruption may
have just begun.</p>

<p>The reality of the natural man&#8217;s spiritual death is
abundantly illustrated in human history. After man
fell into sin, and died, he was given fullest opportunity
to recover himself and to demonstrate thereby
that he was still spiritually alive. But the corruption
<span class="pgbrk"><a name="png.028" id="png.028"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">28</span><span class="ns">]</span></span>
of spiritual death worked until man was so far
down in the filth of his moral putrefaction that the
only way God could save the race from extinction
was to save the one family that had accepted spiritual
life from Him, and blot the rest of the race out in
the flood.</p>

<p>Then, starting out again under more favorable circumstances
than before, man went from bad to worse
until, in one great universal brotherhood, he rose up
and defied God at the Tower of Babel, and God had
to smash the brotherhood into fragments by the confusion
of languages.</p>

<p>Time after time God tried man and found his progress
downward always, no matter how favorable the
circumstances that surrounded him, until finally he
came to earth Himself in the Person of His Son.
This brought both the reality and the completeness
of man&#8217;s spiritual death to a demonstration that can
never be refuted, for at the cross man displayed, to
its eternal uncovering, the awful corruption of that
spiritual condition that could not tolerate in its presence
incarnate purity and holiness, even though he
had to become the murderer of God manifest in the
flesh to get away from it.</p>

<p>Even in his worship man&#8217;s progress is steadily downward.
Beginning with God, he progresses downward
until he is worshipping birds, then beasts, and then
creeping things.</p>

<p>But evolution says that man is <b>coming up</b> from
primitive conditions into fuller life. And so the evolutionist
cannot tolerate such doctrines as these which
the Word of God sets forth. To a consistent evolutionist,
man is not spiritually dead, for that would
<span class="pgbrk"><a name="png.029" id="png.029"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">29</span><span class="ns">]</span></span>
make progress out of the question. And if progress
upward is denied&mdash;if the only progress possible to
the natural man is progress in corruption, then the
whole doctrine of evolution is gone.</p>

<p>This is why it becomes necessary for Canon E. W.
Barnes, of Westminster Abbey, when he accepts evolution,
to reject the Bible. He says:
<span class="bquote">The inevitable acceptance of evolution means
giving up belief in the fall and in all the theology
built upon it by the theologians from St. Paul
onward. Man was not made perfect and then
marred; his evolution is still proceeding.</span></p>

<p>So here again it is utterly impossible for the consistent
evolutionist to accept the Bible doctrine of the
fall of man.</p>

<h4 class="s2"><a name="ref.I.II.3" id="ref.I.II.3"></a><b>3.</b> The logic of evolution destroys the doctrine of
<i>sin</i>.</h4>

<p>The Bible makes man&#8217;s fall deliberate and wilful,
and his continued attitude of sinful enmity against
God, in spite of all God&#8217;s offered power to change it
into love, one of excuseless lawlessness and rebellion.</p>

<p>This makes man entirely responsible for his sin and
accountable to God for everything sin does in his life.
And so the Bible says:
<span class="bquote">Every one shall give account of himself to God.</span></p>

<p>And those who go out of this life in the unconfessed
and therefore unforgiven sin of rejecting God's mercy
in Christ shall &#8220;go away into everlasting punishment,&#8221;
where there will be &#8220;weeping and gnashing of teeth.&#8221;</p>

<p>But to the evolutionary philosophy, sin cannot be
<span class="pgbrk"><a name="png.030" id="png.030"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">30</span><span class="ns">]</span></span>
&#8220;exceeding sinful,&#8221; for it is either inherent in the
process of evolution, or, at worst, but an unfortunate
slip in the working out of that process, if, indeed, it
is not even a mark of budding virtue.</p>

<p>John Fiske says:
<span class="bquote">Theology has much to say about original sin.
This original sin is neither more nor less than the
brute inheritance that every man carries with
him.</span></p>

<p>Rev. Dwight Bradley, a Cleveland, Ohio, pastor,
says:
<span class="bquote">There is no escape for intelligent people today
from the acceptance of the law of evolution....
It follows that what we call evil [sin]
is the remains of a lower form of life....
We are in the midst of the slow process of ridding
ourselves of our animal inheritance.</span></p>

<p>And Dr. Shailer Mathews follows the evolutionary
philosophy to its logical and necessary end when he
says:
<span class="bquote">But for men who think of God as dynamically
imminent in an infinite universe, who think of
man's relation to Him as determined not by statutory
but by cosmic law, who regard sin and
righteousness alike as the working out of the
fundamental forces of life itself, the conception
of God as King and of man as condemned or acquitted
subject is but a figure of speech.</span></p>

<p>Such a doctrine as this absolutely and forever destroys
man&#8217;s responsibility for sin. For if sin is what
Dr. Mathews suggests it is,&mdash;&#8220;the working out of the
fundamental forces of life itself,&#8220;&mdash;then it is inherent
<span class="pgbrk"><a name="png.031" id="png.031"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">31</span><span class="ns">]</span></span>
in man&#8217;s natural constitution as a process of his evolution.
And if this is so, man is in no way responsible
for his sin.</p>

<p>This altogether removes man&#8217;s accountability to God,
for he cannot be brought to account for that which is
the working out of the fundamental forces of life
itself, and which is therefore inevitable in the very
workings of his nature. And even if sin is an unfortunate
slip in the process of evolution, man cannot
be held accountable for an accident.</p>

<p>This doctrine also puts a high premium on the whole
beastly, selfish, lustful, murderous history of the race,
for it makes sin a ladder up which man is climbing
to his high destiny.</p>

<p>Punishment for sin is therefore absolutely out of
the question. For if man is not responsible for his
sin, and if God punishes him for it, as the Bible says
He will, even by the law of cause and effect, that would
make God an infinite tyrant and an unspeakable fiend.
And so if God is not a monster, and if evolution is
true, there is no punishment for sin, and the Bible lies.</p>

<p>Thinking men see that this is the inevitable logic
of the doctrine of evolution. Sir J. William Dawson,
speaking of the evolutionary doctrines as speculations,
says:
<span class="bquote">They seek to revolutionize the religious beliefs
of the world, and if accepted would destroy much
of the existing theology and philosophy....
With one class of minds they constitute a sort of
religion.... With another and perhaps
larger class, they are accepted as affording a welcome
deliverance from all scruples of conscience
and fears of a hereafter.</span></p>

<p><span class="pgbrk"><a name="png.032" id="png.032"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">32</span><span class="ns">]</span></span>
The theory of evolution cannot be consistently held
and the statements of the Bible concerning sin and
its consequences be accepted at the same time. And
so the evolutionist will come, sooner or later, to refuse
any meaning to Scripture statements concerning
sin, as did Dr. W. N. Clarke, when he said:
<span class="bquote">We have no historical narrative of the beginning
of sin, and theology receives from the Scriptures
no record of that beginning.</span></p>

<p>That is, the perfectly plain and easily understood
statements of Scripture concerning the beginning of
sin are altogether unhistorical and utterly unworthy
of credence to the man who looks at the Bible from
the &#8220;scientific&#8221; or &#8220;historical&#8221; standpoint, which is
the evolutionist&#8217;s method of handling the Word of
God. To accept evolution, therefore, is to discredit
the Bible.</p>

<h4 class="s2"><a name="ref.I.II.4" id="ref.I.II.4"></a><b>4.</b> The logic of evolution destroys the doctrines
<a name="tn4" id="tn4"></a><ins class="TNsilent" title="Duplicate of removed">
of the <i>Deity</i></ins> and the <i>virgin birth</i> of the Lord Jesus
Christ.</h4>

<p>The Bible makes Christ the Seed of the woman,
not of the man, as all other human beings are; it
makes His conception to have been that of the Holy
Spirit; it declares His virgin birth in language that
cannot be misunderstood; it makes Him the Son of
God, not the son of Joseph.</p>

<p>It also makes Him God tabernacling in the flesh;
it makes Him the Second Person of the Triune <b>God</b>;
it declares in so many words that He <b>is</b> God.</p>

<p>But evolution cannot accept such a doctrine, and
so the evolutionist juggles the Scripture statements
<span class="pgbrk"><a name="png.033" id="png.033"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">33</span><span class="ns">]</span></span>
of His Deity and denies His virgin birth, making Him
a Jewish bastard, born out of wedlock, and stained
forever with the shame of His mother's immorality.</p>

<p>Dr. A. C. McGiffert says of Christ, that He is
<span class="bquote">no more divine than we are, or than nature is.</span></p>

<p>A magazine article on &#8220;The Cosmic Coming of the
Christ&#8221; says:
<span class="bquote">First the little scum on the warm, stagnant
water, then the little colonies of cells, the organisms,
the green moss and lichen, the beauty of
vegetation, the movement of shell fish, sponges,
jelly fish, worms, crabs, trilobites, centipedes, insects,
fish, frogs, lizards, dinosaurs, reptile birds,
birds, kangaroos, mastodons, deer, apes, primitive
man, cave man, man of the stone age, of earliest
history, Abraham's migration, the Exodus, the development
of the Jewish religious life and the
climax in that purest of maidens, Mary of Nazareth.
The hour had come for the dawn of a new
day, and the light of that new day was the birth
of Jesus. The eternal purpose of the ages was now
to be made clear, and the long, long aeons of creation
explained.</span></p>

<p>It is no wonder that after quoting these words the
&#8220;Sunday School Times&#8221; exclaims:
<span class="bquote">In other words, without moss we could not have
had Mary; without an ape we could not have had
Abraham; and&mdash;shocking blasphemy&mdash;without a
centipede we could not have had Christ! Praise
God, we may turn from this to the words of God;
"For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of
the wise, and the discernment of the discerning I
will bring to naught."</span></p>

<p><span class="pgbrk"><a name="png.034" id="png.034"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">34</span><span class="ns">]</span></span>
And so here once more the consistent evolutionist
is compelled to reject the Bible by denying the doctrines
of the Deity and the virgin birth of Christ.</p>

<h4 class="s2"><a name="ref.I.II.5" id="ref.I.II.5"></a><b>5.</b> The logic of evolution destroys the doctrine of
<i>atonement by substitution</i>.</h4>

<p>The Bible says:
<span class="bquote">Without the shedding of blood there is no remission
[of sin].</span>

<span class="bquote">Him who knew no sin He hath made to be sin
for us.</span>

<span class="bquote">The Lord hath laid on Him the iniquity of us all.</span>

<span class="bquote">Who Himself bore our sins in His own body on
the tree.</span>

<span class="bquote">We "were redeemed ... with the precious
blood of Christ."</span>

<span class="bquote">We are "justified by His blood."</span>

<span class="bquote">The blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanseth us
from all sin.</span></p>

<p>These and many other statements make Christ&#8217;s
death one of atonement by substitution for our sins.</p>

<p>But evolution cannot tolerate such a doctrine. To
the evolutionist this is a &#8220;doctrine of the shambles,&#8221;
a &#8220;slaughter house religion,&#8221; a &#8220;gospel of gore.&#8221;
Christ&#8217;s death is rather a revelation of the evolutionist&#8217;s
conception of divine love, and an example of
sacrificial service set before struggling man to help
him climb. Let those who believe in the evolutionist&#8217;s
&#8220;historical&#8220; method of interpreting Scripture
speak for themselves.</p>

<p>Dr. Gerald Birney Smith, of the University of Chicago,
says:

age that has abandoned the conception of bloody
sacrifice and which is loudly demanding the abolition
of capital punishment.</span></p>

<p>Dr. Walter Rauschenbusch said:
<span class="bquote">What the death of Jesus now does for us, the
death of the prophets did for him.</span></p>

<p>Dr. H. C. Vedder says:

our stead and bore the penalty of our sins;</span>
and also:
<span class="bquote">The "one crowning absurdity of theology" is
"that the penalty of an evil deed can be vicariously
borne by another while he goes scot free,"</span>
which he describes in another place as
<span class="bquote">taking an immunity bath in the "fountain filled
with blood."</span></p>

<p>And Dr. J. H. Coffin, of Earlham College, Earlham,
Indiana, says:
<span class="bquote">
The sacrificial life of Jesus is the essential factor
in His atonement. His principles and example
are the way of the individual and society
to God.</span></p>

<p>Such statements make it perfectly evident that
those who accept evolution utterly reject God&#8217;s provision
for salvation through the shed blood of Christ
as an atonement by substitution for our sins.</p>

<h4 class="s2"><a name="ref.I.II.6" id="ref.I.II.6"></a><b>6.</b> The logic of evolution destroys the doctrine of
<b>regeneration</b>.</h4>

<p><span class="pgbrk"><a name="png.036" id="png.036"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">36</span><span class="ns">]</span></span>
The Bible describes man as dead to God and running
away from Him; as having a nature so full of
corruption that &#8220;From the sole of the foot even unto
the head there is no soundness in it, but wounds, and
bruises, and putrifying sores&#8221;; and as having a character
in the grip of such enmity against God that by
nature he &#8220;loves darkness rather than light.&#8221;</p>

<p>This indicates that man is <b>past improvement</b> in his
natural state, for no improvement is possible in the
dead.</p>

<p>The Bible therefore speaks, not of the improvement,
but of the burial, of the old life, and of resurrection,
by the power of a new nature, to newness of life.
Hear what it says:
<span class="bquote">We were buried with Christ by baptism into
death, that like as Christ was raised up from the
dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also
should walk in newness of life.</span></p>

<p>There is a large section of the Church that understand
this passage to refer to immersion in water in
confession of faith in Christ. Not that they believe
that immersion has anything to do with saving us, for
they do not, but that it is the divinely appointed symbol
or picture of the salvation that has already become
a reality in the life.</p>

<p>To an immersionist, therefore, when a believer is
buried with Christ in symbol in his baptism, and raised
again in symbol of resurrection, he confesses, among
other things, that by his first birth he is so completely
dead that there is nothing left to do with him but to
bury him, and his willingness to be buried in the
grave of Christ has been met by God with the gift of
<span class="pgbrk"><a name="png.037" id="png.037"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">37</span><span class="ns">]</span></span>
the risen and incorruptible life which is in His Son,
and by which he is now enabled to walk in newness
of life.</p>

<p>And so an immersionist cannot be a consistent evolutionist.
For when an evolutionist is immersed, he
is either perpetrating a meaningless travesty on immersion,
or else he is denying the whole doctrine of
evolution. For immersion certainly does not picture
a step in the progress of the living, but rather the
burial of the totally dead. Immersing churches that
have gone over to the evolutionary position should
therefore be consistent and nail up their baptistries.</p>

<p>But another large portion of the Church believe that
the above passage does not refer to immersion in water,
but rather to the statement:
<span class="bquote">For by one Spirit have we all been baptized
into one body.</span></p>

<p>They regard it as referring to the inward, spiritual
union with Christ which takes place in the new birth,
rather than to an outward act. For in the moment
of regeneration, every believer is baptized by the Holy
Spirit into the Body of Christ.</p>

<p>But even so, the word &#8220;buried&#8221; still stands in the
first passage above, and a burial has to do with the
dead, not with the living. Being &#8220;buried,&#8221; therefore,
when the Holy Spirit baptizes us into Christ, it is
&#8220;into death,&#8221; not into an enlarging life, because we
are so completely dead that the baptizing Spirit sets
the &#8220;old man&#8221; forever aside as utterly unimprovable,
in order that He may make us &#8220;partakers of
the divine nature&#8221; by which we become a &#8220;new creation&#8221;
in Christ.</p>

<p><span class="pgbrk"><a name="png.038" id="png.038"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">38</span><span class="ns">]</span></span>
All this, however, is utterly intolerable to the consistent
evolutionist. For if man is dead and therefore
unimprovable, that makes progress upward impossible,
and, if that is impossible, the whole doctrine of evolution
is at an end.</p>

<p>And so the evolutionist assumes the presence of
life, and conceives the race to be progressing upward
out of crude forms and unethical conceptions toward
God. It is perfectly consistent, therefore, that he
should seek to stir man&#8217;s noble aspirations and should
present high ideals for him to strive after. For it
is not life man needs, they say, it is simply conversion
to higher ideals and aspirations in life.</p>

<p>Hence Dr. E. D. Burton is in perfect harmony with
this evolutionary conception when he says:
<span class="bquote">Jesus was a teacher of great principles, which
it is incumbent upon us to apply to the multitudinous
phases and experiences of life, and the
embodiment of an ideal, which it is ours to endeavor,
as best we can, to achieve.</span></p>

<p>Dr. Herbert L. Willett, of the University of Chicago,
was also in harmony with all this when he said in an
address heard by the writer:
<span class="bquote">It is the task of the Church to interpret to the
world the ideals of Jesus for men to strive after.</span></p>

<p>And Dr. J. H. Coffin also voiced the evolutionary
position when, in speaking of conversion, he said:
<span class="bquote">It is conversion <b>to</b> something, namely, the <b>principles</b>
of Jesus.</span></p>

<p>Now when the logic of this conception is followed
out, it turns evangelism into religious education. And
<span class="pgbrk"><a name="png.039" id="png.039"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">39</span><span class="ns">]</span></span>
so it is easy to see why the advocates of evolution
are stressing religious education with increasing insistence.
For it is through the methods of religious
education, according to Dr. Burton, that the lost are
being
<span class="bquote">led to adopt the principles of Jesus and to accept
his leadership quietly and gradually.</span></p>

<p>This makes regeneration simply an added impulse
in the direction in which men are imagined already
to be going. It also has the effect of altogether reversing
the emphasis in the work of the Church with
the lost. According to Dr. Burton, it transfers it
<span class="bquote">from the salvation of the individual, with emphasis
upon rescue from future woe, to the creation
of a human society dominated by the spirit
of Jesus.</span></p>

<p>And Dr. Gerald Birney Smith, speaking of present-day
missionary methods, says:
<span class="bquote">Humanly determined programs are being substituted
for dogmatic decrees in the work of the
churches. This is genuine democracy. The missionary
enterprise is rapidly being conceived as
a democratic social program rather than as the
rescue of a few individuals from the divine wrath....
Education is coming to be a primary
means of accomplishing the missionary task.</span></p>

<p>Such a mission to the lost would be altogether unthinkable
if men were believed to be spiritually dead.
For dead men are helpless to adopt principles and
strive after ideals. Dead men do not need education,
they need life.</p>

<p><span class="pgbrk"><a name="png.040" id="png.040"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">40</span><span class="ns">]</span></span>
Any one of average intelligence can see at a glance
that these two programs of salvation are headed in
opposite directions. By one we strive after an ideal;
by the other we quit all striving and surrender to a
Person. One is salvation by a human resolution to
press toward the pattern set before us by the &#8220;Flower
of the Race&#8221;; the other is salvation by a divine rescue
from that natural hatred of purity and holiness which
made possible the murder of the Son of God. By one
program we adopt the principles and follow the spirit
of the life of Christ; by the other we trust in the
merits of the shed blood and substitutionary death
of Christ.</p>

<p>These two programs are mutually exclusive. Thus
the evolutionary philosophy utterly destroys the doctrine
of the new birth.</p>

<h4 class="s2"><a name="ref.I.II.7" id="ref.I.II.7"></a><b>7.</b> The logic of evolution destroys the doctrine of
the <b>holiness of God</b>, for it makes God the <b>author of sin</b>.</h4>

<p>Le Conte says:
<span class="bquote">If evolution be true, and especially if man be
indeed a product of evolution, then what we call
evil is not a unique phenomenon confined to man
and the result of an accident [the fall], but must
be a great fact pervading all nature and a part
of its very constitution.</span></p>

<p>No thinking man can get away from that conclusion.
For if evolution in any form is a fact, then the
thing the Bible calls sin was either somehow embedded,
by a competent and responsible Creator, in man&#8217;s
very constitution as a necessary process of his evolution,
or else it slipped into the race through the bungling
<span class="pgbrk"><a name="png.041" id="png.041"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">41</span><span class="ns">]</span></span>
and unwatchful incompetence of an impotent
Creator. Thus in either case God becomes the author
of sin!</p>

<p>This puts evolution almost, if not altogether, on the
ground of blasphemy! God responsible for the unspeakable
woe and the unmeasured suffering of man?
God the author of that inherent force in man&#8217;s nature
which has filled the earth with hatred, violence, bloodshed,
and death? Let him think so who can!</p>

<p>After these doctrines of the Word are set beside
the evolutionary philosophy, and after it begins to
dawn on the thinking mind how utterly irreconcilable
they are, the absolute impossibility of a consistent
evolutionist believing in an inspired, inerrant, and
infallible Bible becomes well nigh an axiom. It is
no wonder that Dr. W. B. Riley exclaims:
<span class="bquote">What thinking man fails to see the infinity of
space between Modernism and Orthodoxy, or to
apprehend the fact that daily they are drawing
farther apart! Time holds no promise of even a
patched-up peace.</span></p>

<p>Lord Kelvin was astonished at the preachers and
teachers who are trying to apply the doctrine of evolution
to the fundamentals of the faith. He said:
<span class="bquote">I marvel at the undue haste with which teachers
in our Universities and preachers in our pulpits
are restating the truth in the terms of evolution,
while evolution itself remains an unproven hypothesis
in the laboratories of science.</span></p>

<p>And well might he marvel. And well might the
Church become aroused and alarmed as the logical
workings of these false doctrines produce more and
<span class="pgbrk"><a name="png.042" id="png.042"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">42</span><span class="ns">]</span></span>
more fearful results within her ranks. The whole
Church is being moved away from the foundations
of the faith, and this false philosophy is at the bottom
of it all.</p>

<p>The group announcements of the Sunday services
of the Los Angeles liberal churches show where all
consistent evolutionists are headed. Standing at the
head of these announcements are these words, the
capital letters being theirs:
<span class="bquote">We found our faith on the thought of EVOLUTION
rather than Special Creation; on revelation
through NORMAL HUMAN EXPERIENCE rather
than the supernatural; on salvation through
GROWTH rather than a miraculous rebirth.</span></p>

<p>And when it comes to the awful harvest that is
being gathered from our churches for the forces of
spiritual destruction through our colleges and universities,
William Jennings Bryan has had some information
given to him that will give us a hint of
what is going on. He says:
<span class="bquote">Having had opportunity to make a personal investigation,
I feel it my duty to warn the lovers
of the Bible of the insidious attacks which are
being made upon every vital part of the Word
of God. A father tells me of a daughter educated
at Wellesley who calmly informs him that
no one believes in the Bible now; a teacher in
Columbia University begins his lessons in geology
by asking students to lay aside all that they have
learned in Sunday-school; a professor of the University
of Wisconsin tells his class that the Bible
is a collection of myths; a professor of philosophy
at Ann Arbor occupies a Sunday evening explaining
to an audience that Christianity is a state of
<span class="pgbrk"><a name="png.043" id="png.043"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">43</span><span class="ns">]</span></span>
mind and that there are only two books in the
Bible with any literary merit; another professor
in the same institution informs students that he
once taught a Sunday-school class and was active
in the Young Men's Christian Association, but
that no thinking man can believe in God or the
Bible; a woman teacher in a public school in
Indiana rebukes a boy for answering that Adam
was the first man, explaining to him and the class
that the "tree man" was the first man; a young
man in South Carolina traces his atheism back
to two teachers in a Christian college; a senior
in an Illinois high school writes that he became
skeptical during his sophomore year but has been
brought back by influences outside of school while
others of his class are agnostics; a professor in
Yale has the reputation of making atheists of all
who come under his influence&mdash;this information
was given by a boy whose brother has come under
the influence of this teacher; a professor in Bryn
Mawr combats Christianity for a session and then
puts to his class the question whether or not there
is a God, and is happy to find that a majority of
the class vote that there is no God; a professor
in a Christian college writes a book in which the
virgin birth of Christ is disputed; one professor
declares that life is merely a by-product and will
ultimately be produced in the laboratory; another
says that the ingredients necessary to create life
have already been brought together and that life
will be developed from these ingredients, adding,
however, that it will require a million years to do
it. These are a few of the illustrations furnished
by informants whom I have reason to believe.</span></p>

<p>These facts certainly furnish sufficient reason why
the Church cannot compromise with the evolutionary
philosophy. To do so would be to head herself toward
destruction. She must stand uncompromised and
<span class="pgbrk"><a name="png.044" id="png.044"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">44</span><span class="ns">]</span></span>
unflinching against that unproven and discredited
theory, the acceptance of which destroys faith in that
infallible and inerrant Word on which she was founded,
and on whose &#8220;thus saith the Lord&#8221; she must rest
her message to a lost world. <b>There is no middle
ground. To compromise would be to commit suicide.</b>
If the Church and the Schools are ever to come into
harmony, it cannot be because the Church gives up
an infallible Book and accepts a discredited theory
in its place, and so it must be because the Schools
give up this unscientific, because unproven, theory
and get back to faith in the inerrant Word of God.</p>

<p>That this is the only basis on which the Church
and the Schools can ever come into harmony is strenuously
denied by the evolutionists in both Schools and
Church. But their denial is meaningless when it is
remembered that they are working night and day to
capture the Church, as they have already almost done
with the Schools, before we wake up to what is going
on. But it can never be done. The true Church will
never surrender to those who would remove her foundations
and wreck her message.</p>

<h3><a href="#ref.II" id="ref.II"></a>
CHAPTER II</h3>
<h4>The Present Controversy&mdash;the Cure</h4>

<p>In the previous pages we went back to the cause
of the present controversy between the Church and
the Schools. We found that the unproven and discredited
theory of evolution lies at the bottom of it.
We also concluded that no compromise that permits
entrance to this theory in any form is possible, for
the truth which is at once both the life and the message
of the Church, and the theory of evolution, are mutually
exclusive.</p>

<p>In this chapter we will seek to find the cure for
this distressing controversy. That there is a cure is
beyond all possible question. And if it is not found
and applied, the controversy cannot fail to intensify
until it may force a re-alignment in the Church&mdash;a
thing a great company of the most earnest in the
Church are fighting to prevent.</p>

<p>Now the only possible basis on which both the
Church and the Schools can take their stand, if this
controversy is to be settled without final disunion in
the Church, was laid down by Christ in that scientific
formula:
<span class="bquote">If any man willeth to do His will, he shall know
of the teaching, whether it be of God, or whether
I speak from Myself.</span></p>

<p>To follow this formula in our search for common
<span class="pgbrk"><a name="png.046" id="png.046"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">46</span><span class="ns">]</span></span>
ground is to be utterly scientific, for it is the laboratory
method of experiment. The true Church has always
believed and received the Bible as the inerrant Word
of God, not because, in blind credulity, she has followed
some irrational and unscientific impulse, but
precisely because she has been <b>scientific enough</b> to
work by this formula and carry the laboratory test
to its <b>final analysis</b>. And for the Schools to follow
this same formula with scientific accuracy would be
for them to arrive at the same place at which the true
Church has arrived. For when the Church and the
Schools start out in search of truth and do not arrive
together, it is either because they did not start together,
or because one or both of them did not proceed
all the way with scientific exactness. Truth is
an eternal unity, and conclusions regarding it that
are mutually exclusive and therefore the cause of controversy
prove to a demonstration that somebody&#8217;s
methods of investigation were unscientific.</p>

<p>If we really intend to be scientific, therefore, when
we start out to investigate truth of any sort and in
any realm, the first thing we will do will be to classify.
We can neither start nor proceed together unless we
do. Indeed, if we are to be scientific enough to follow
the formula laid down by Christ, we will be compelled
to classify before we can even begin our investigation.
Therefore&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="s1"><a name="ref.II.I" id="ref.II.I"></a>I. Truth Must Be Classified Scientifically.</h4>

<h4 class="s2"><a name="ref.II.I.1" id="ref.II.I.1"></a><b>1.</b> The <b>Realms of Truth</b> Must Be Classified.</h4>

<p>The first thing the true scientist does is to classify
truth into realms. This we have already done by
classifying the realm in which God reveals His moral
<span class="pgbrk"><a name="png.047" id="png.047"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">47</span><span class="ns">]</span></span>
character to the hearts of all moral beings as the
<b>spiritual</b> realm, and that in which He reveals His
creative power to the minds of all intelligent beings as
the <b>natural</b> realm.</p>

<p>If we do not distinguish these realms to start with,
we invite confusion; and if we should reach right
conclusions without this classification, it would be due
to accident, rather than to scientific accuracy.</p>

<p>But that this classification is universally recognized
is proved by the fact that the moment science reaches
the line where the natural ends and the spiritual begins,
it pursues its investigations no farther, on the
ground that it has neither the implements nor the
capacities with which to investigate in that realm.
This proves as conclusively as anything could that
the distinction between these two realms is so sharp,
as well as so self-evident, that science is compelled to
accept it and act accordingly.</p>

<h4 class="s2"><a name="ref.II.I.2" id="ref.II.I.2"></a><b>2.</b> The <b>Faculties of Investigation</b> Must be Distinguished.</h4>

<p>The scientific man will next distinguish the faculties
with which the investigating is to be done, according
to the respective realms. That this classification is
required by the fundamental difference in the nature
of the truths in these two realms is so self-evident
that it ought to be axiomatic to all who think with
any degree of scientific accuracy. For in the nature
of things, <b>natural</b> truth requires investigation by <b>intellectual</b>
faculties, and <b>spiritual</b> truth by <b>spiritual</b>
faculties. Indeed, this distinction is fully recognized
when science halts its pursuit of truth at the boundary
line of the spiritual realm.</p>

<p><span class="pgbrk"><a name="png.048" id="png.048"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">48</span><span class="ns">]</span></span>
Yet, although this classification is theoretically recognized
by science, and although it is absolutely demanded
if we are to proceed scientifically in our
researches in the spiritual realm, it is little less than
amazing how many there are who utterly fail to distinguish
these faculties when they start out to investigate
spiritual truth. Indeed, this is the first place
where the Church and the Schools part company. For
the whole attitude of our Schools today, including most
of the institutions founded and fostered by the Church,
seems to be one that entirely misses the scientific
necessity of distinguishing between these essentially
different faculties when working in these two utterly
divergent realms of truth. And so it comes to pass
that while the Church is using one sort of faculties,
the Schools are using another kind on the same class
of truth.</p>

<p>It needs scarcely to be argued that the <b>intellect</b>,
with its capacity to <b>reason</b>, is the proper faculty of
apprehension in the scientific realm. But it is equally
true that the <b>heart</b>, with its capacity to <b>believe</b>, is
the one faculty of apprehension in the spiritual realm.
That is, the inquirer reasons his way to knowledge in
the natural realm, and believes his way to knowledge
in the spiritual realm. He uses his mind in order to
understand what God has done in His creation, and
he exercises faith in order to come into the knowledge
of what He is in His character. In natural things
he believes because he understands, and in spiritual
things he understands because he believes.</p>

<p>In drawing this contrast between mind and heart,
however, it is fully recognized that the term &#8220;heart,&#8221;
in much if not all of Scripture, stands for the whole
<span class="pgbrk"><a name="png.049" id="png.049"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">49</span><span class="ns">]</span></span>
personality, including intellect, emotion and will. But
it is also a fact that this term stands for that certain
<b>attitude</b> of the whole personality toward God through
His Word in which one believes and receives His
Word without question, even though it may not be
understood, rather than insisting on understanding it
in order to believe it.</p>

<p>Paul says by inspiration in <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext05/bib4610h.htm#begin" target="_blank">First Corinthians</a> 1:17
to 2:16 that <b>mental</b> capacity, even of the highest excellence,
when exercised by itself, is utterly incapable
of apprehending spiritual truth in any degree whatever.
And Christ says that it is with the <b>heart</b> that
man believes unto righteousness. This defines that
attitude of the whole personality which accepts the
Word of God on faith without necessarily understanding
it, and which gives evidence of acceptance by
such a whole-hearted surrender to it as will eventuate
in a life of righteousness.</p>

<p>Then in other Scriptures we find that a life of
righteousness, according to the divine standard, is
based on right relations with God in Christ through
faith in His shed blood, through whose incoming and
indwelling life, in response to such a faith, the one who
receives it will normally live in right relations with his
fellow men. That is, it is a righteousness that is obtained
by <b>believing</b>, not attained by <b>working</b>. It is
received, not achieved.</p>

<p>The use of the term &#8220;heart,&#8221; therefore, in Scripture,
means that certain attitude of the whole personality
toward God through His Word which the exercise
of the intellect apart from, and unfounded on, faith
makes impossible.</p>

<p>It is precisely this distinction in faculties that
<span class="pgbrk"><a name="png.050" id="png.050"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">50</span><span class="ns">]</span></span>
Christ's formula requires. For it was <b>spiritual</b> truth,
not natural, of which He spoke when He said, &#8220;<b>If</b>
any man wills to do, he shall <b>know</b>.&#8221; To work by
this formula requires the exercise of faith. For faith
is that attitude of the heart toward the doing of God's
will which is evidenced in <b>willing to do</b> that will, no
matter what it costs nor where it leads. This is the
first step of faith. For faith is both an attitude and
an act, the genuineness of which is proven by an
activity. That is, it is an attitude of willingness toward
the will of God, an act of surrender to the will
of God, eventuating in an activity in continuing in
the will of God. Therefore complete surrender of the
heart and life to God&#8217;s will as revealed in the Word,
trusting the outcome to Him, is where faith begins.</p>

<p>And so let no man imagine that he has any real
faith either in God or His Word who has not begun by
willing to do, that he may enter upon the doing of,
the will of God. Indeed, this is not simply the place
where faith begins, it is also the only place where
the presence of faith can be demonstrated. For this
is the only possible way of distinguishing that intellectual
attitude which simply assents to the truthfulness
of the Word, from that genuine heart faith
which actively reckons the Word to be true by surrendering
the life to its requirements. This formula
of Christ&#8217;s, therefore, not only requires that the spiritual
and natural faculties be distinguished, but it is
the one scientific test by which they <b>can</b> be distinguished.</p>

<p>Then there is Paul&#8217;s classification of these faculties
just referred to. It is passing strange that so many
even in our denominational schools have missed it.
<span class="pgbrk"><a name="png.051" id="png.051"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">51</span><span class="ns">]</span></span>
He devotes a whole section of <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext05/bib4610h.htm#begin" target="_blank">First Corinthians</a>, from
1:17 to 2:16, as noted above, to a scientific statement
of the natural and total incapacity of the intellect
to discern spiritual truth. Consider it a little more
in detail. He says that natural human wisdom,
&#8220;<i>sophia</i>,&#8221; which Aristotle defines as &#8220;mental excellence
in its highest and fullest sense,&#8221; is utterly incapable
of operating in the realm of spiritual investigation.
For after &#8220;the world by mental excellence
knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness (to
the natural mental capacities) of the thing preached
to save those that <b>believe</b>.&#8221; Not those that <b>understand</b>,
for &#8220;the natural man receiveth not the things
of the Spirit of God (that is, spiritual things), for
they are foolishness unto him; neither can he know
(or understand) them, for they are <b>spiritually</b> discerned
(or understood).&#8221; The essential difference between
natural and spiritual faculties, as well as the
utter incapacity of the natural faculties in the spiritual
realm, are so clearly brought out in this passage that
it is impossible to miss it.</p>

<p>By this it is not at all meant, however, that mental
training and intellectual capacity have no place in
certain branches of Bible study. Every believer in
the Book welcomes the keenest minds and the most
expert scholarship in that branch of Bible study, for
example, which seeks, by the investigation of the
manuscripts and the variant readings, to arrive at
the very words that were written by the inspired
writers; or, for example, in that other branch of study
which seeks to discover the history and origins of the
various books of the Bible. But it <b>is</b> meant that when
men seek to know the <b>spiritual truths</b> of the Bible,
<span class="pgbrk"><a name="png.052" id="png.052"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">52</span><span class="ns">]</span></span>
they are utterly unscientific if they fail to use that
faculty in their investigation which the Textbook
itself prescribes.</p>

<p>To sum it up, faith opens the way for God to quicken
into activity a spiritual capacity through which <b>He</b>
educates a man in spiritual things entirely independently
of the schools.</p>

<p>The man who really intends to be scientific, then,
will approach the Bible in that attitude of <b>faith</b> which
will lead him to <b>will to do God's will</b> as the Bible
reveals it. He will then be where he can <b>believe</b> his
way to an understanding of spiritual truth.</p>

<h4 class="s2"><a name="ref.II.I.3" id="ref.II.I.3"></a><b>3.</b> The <b>Different Kinds of Truth</b> Must Be Separated.</h4>

<p>Another classification which the scientific man makes
is to distinguish between the two kinds of truth in
each respective realm, and to separate that kind which
may be demonstrated to the <b>experience</b> from that
which must be taken on <b>hearsay</b>. That is, in the
natural realm, in the department of chemistry, for
example, the laws of chemical action can be put to
the laboratory test of experiment, while the history
of the science of chemistry must always be taken on
hearsay. And, in the spiritual realm, those truths
stated in the spiritual Textbook which have to do
with our spiritual relations with God can be put to
the laboratory test of the experiment of faith, while
all the rest must be taken on hearsay.</p>

<h4 class="s2"><a name="ref.II.I.4" id="ref.II.I.4"></a><b>4.</b> The <b>Primacy of Primary Truth</b> Must Be Maintained.</h4>

<p>One thing more which the scientific man does is to
accord primacy to that realm of truth which is primary
<span class="pgbrk"><a name="png.053" id="png.053"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">53</span><span class="ns">]</span></span>
in importance. In order to do this, the scientific spirit
compels the one possessed by it to meet two requirements.</p>

<p>Recognizing that truth is an eternal unity, he will
first determine to deal with the facts in any given
realm in such a way as to preserve harmony at all
times between them and all the known facts of all
the other realms. For only thus can he avoid destroying
the unity of truth and heading himself toward
error and confusion.</p>

<p>He will then determine to maintain the primacy of
primary truth by <b>interpreting in its light the facts of
all other realms</b>. That is, he will make that realm
whose truths are of transcendent importance the norm,
or standard, by which to interpret the facts of other
realms, withholding interpretations until the facts of
any other given realm can be interpreted in harmony
with those primary truths which have been made forever
secure by being scientifically verified.</p>

<p>These requirements would seem so axiomatic as to
need no emphasis, and yet, strange as it may seem,
right here is another place where the Church and the
Schools part company. For the Church is according
primacy to one realm of truth, and the Schools to
another, making unity of final conclusions out of the
question.</p>

<p>If we are to be possessed by the scientific spirit
and proceed with scientific accuracy, however, we will
be compelled, in the terms of our present study, to
accord that primacy to the <b>spiritual</b> realm over the
<b>natural</b> which its transcendent importance demands.
For by as much as truth about <b>God</b> is of more eternal
value to sinful man than truth about His <b>creation</b>,
<span class="pgbrk"><a name="png.054" id="png.054"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">54</span><span class="ns">]</span></span>
and by as much as truth by which we are <b>saved</b> is
of more transcendent importance than truth by which
we are <b>informed</b>, by just that much will the scientific
spirit compel us to interpret every bit of information
that comes to us from the natural realm in harmony
with, and in the light of, the truths of the spiritual
realm, for by this method alone can we maintain the
primacy of the spiritual realm over the natural.</p>

<p>This means that the man who is truly scientific
will never interpret discoveries in the natural realm
in such a way as to deny or even throw doubt upon
those fundamental truths in the spiritual realm which
have been forever secured by scientific demonstration.
In other words, he will not seek to bring the Bible
into harmony with man&#8217;s interpretation of scientific
facts, but he will seek to bring every scientific discovery
into harmony with the Bible, withholding final
conclusions from all discoveries that will not so harmonize
until he has light enough so they will.</p>

<p>We have now reached the point where we can sum
up all the requirements which the really scientific man
will meet in order that he may be able to proceed
with scientific accuracy in his researches in the realms
of truth. He will separate the natural and the spiritual
realms of truth from each other. He will investigate
natural truth with the intellect and spiritual truth
with faith. He will distinguish truth that can be
demonstrated to the experience from that which must
be accepted on testimony alone. And he will accord
primacy to the spiritual realm over the natural.</p>

<p>It only remains to be said that the man who will
not meet these requirements is a total stranger to the
<span class="pgbrk"><a name="png.055" id="png.055"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">55</span><span class="ns">]</span></span>
scientific spirit. &#8220;The Standard Dictionary&#8221; says
that science is &#8220;knowledge gained and verified by
exact observation and correct thinking,&#8221; and the man
who will not meet requirements that are absolutely
necessary for exact observation and correct thinking
in the gaining and verifying of knowledge does
not have the first qualification of the scientific investigator.
For he is really not open to truth at all,
and is therefore in no position to maintain either the
unity between the realms of truth or the primacy of
primary truth, and exact observation and correct
thinking are out of the question under such conditions.
He cannot verify anything with scientific accuracy
when he will not even classify the different
realms of truth and the faculties of investigation, or
give the realms their respective places in the sphere
of truth. And so it is futile for one who refuses to
do this to talk about being in harmony with the scientific
spirit.</p>

<p>When an investigator meets these requirements, on
the other hand, he is then ready to meet the next demand
made upon the scientific inquirer, which is&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="s1"><a name="ref.II.II" id="ref.II.II"></a>II. Truth Must Be Investigated Scientifically.</h4>

<p>Accepting the self-evident accuracy of the classification
we have just outlined, we will now give attention
to what the scientific spirit will require of
us at those two places where the Church and the
Schools have parted company. For if we can get together
here, we can both proceed and arrive together
in our investigation of truth, and that will end the
controversy.</p>

<a name="ref.II.II.1" id="ref.II.II.1"></a><b>1.</b> <b>Faith</b> Must Be Given Precedence over <b>Reason</b>.</h4>

<p>Let us see what it will mean to give precedence to
faith over reason when we are working in the realm
of spiritual truth.</p>

<p>It will mean that <b>believing</b> will precede <b>reasoning</b>
in our approach to the Word of God, and this defines
the vital distinction between the true Christian
and the rationalist.</p>

<p class="s3"><a name="ref.II.II.1.a" id="ref.II.II.1.a"></a><b>a.</b> The Method of the Rationalist.</p>

<p>Faith and rationalism are mutually exclusive in the
spiritual realm. Rationalizing and doubting are first
cousins when the Word of God is involved.</p>

<p>Satan was the first rationalist on earth, and Eve
fell when she accepted his reasonings about the Word
of God in the place of simple faith in that Word.
For Satan raised a question about the Word,&mdash;&#8220;Yea,
hath God said?&#8221;&mdash;and thereby opened the way for
incipient doubt, and then he reasoned Eve into accepting
a &#8220;common sense&#8221; interpretation of what
God had said, which proved to be an outright denial
of His Word. And look at the consequences&mdash;indescribably
terrible&mdash;of rationalizing about God's Word
instead of believing it!</p>

<p>But rationalism did not stop there, for ever since
that day all men without exception have been natural-born
rationalists. For it is perfectly natural to all
men to <b>rationalize</b> about God's Word, but it takes a
miracle of Divine power to make any one willing to
<b>believe</b> it.</p>

<p>These two attitudes toward Scripture are forever
irreconcilable. In the nature of things, they can never
be harmonized. The believer in the Word and the
rationalist take two utterly divergent paths that cannot
possibly reach the same goal.</p>

<p><span class="pgbrk"><a name="png.057" id="png.057"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">57</span><span class="ns">]</span></span>
The program of the rationalist is to arrive at an
understanding of spiritual truth over the pathway
of reasoning that is apart from faith. That of the
believer is to arrive at it over the pathway of reasoning
that is founded on faith.</p>

<p>The program of the rationalist is to harmonize the
Word of God with his conclusions. That of the believer
is to harmonize his conclusions with the Word.
The program of the rationalist is to become a critic
of the Word and sit in judgment on it. That of the
believer is to let the Word become his critic and sit
in judgment on him.</p>

<p>These are certainly reasons enough why the believer
and the rationalist can never travel together.
For the believer is walking by God's estimate of him,
while the rationalist is walking by his estimate of
God, and these paths go in opposite directions.</p>

<p>If you sit in judgment on some portion of God's
Word and determine that it is reasonable, and that
since it commends itself to your judgment it is therefore
acceptable and you will believe it, <b>that</b> is not
faith in the <b>Word</b> but in <b>your own reason</b>. You have
surrendered your <b>intellect</b> to your own conclusions
but your <b>heart</b> is far from God. Faith in the Word
is surrender to it without passing judgment on it.</p>

<p>And yet surrendering one's mind to one's own conclusions
about God is precisely the thing that passes
for faith in God on the part of those who have lost
their old-fashioned, evangelical faith while they were
in the Schools, and yet come out with what they
describe as a more intelligent and rational faith in
God and the Bible. In their desperate attempt to
survive the wreck of their orthodox faith, they have
<span class="pgbrk"><a name="png.058" id="png.058"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">58</span><span class="ns">]</span></span>
<b>reasoned</b> their way to conclusions about God that
harmonized with what they were taught in the Schools;
but the God they arrived at was the god of rationalism
and not the God of Revelation.</p>

<p>They will say to the orthodox man, &#8220;You and I
go by different pathways, but we both arrive at the
same God.&#8221; But this is eternally impossible! For
there is only one pathway leading to the true God,
and that is not followed by <b>reasoning</b> one&#8217;s way out
of a shattered faith, but first by <b>believing</b> one&#8217;s way
out of darkness into light, and then by believing
steadily on in that divinely imparted faith which always
shatters the reasonings and conclusions of the
rationalists.</p>

<p>To be a believer in the Word puts rationalism out
of business, for no one can reason himself into the
acceptance of truth he already believes. And on the
other hand, to be a rationalist regarding the Word
puts faith out of business, for faith is the acceptance
of the bare Word of God without further evidence,
and the rationalizer is compelled to reject that attitude
toward the Word so that he may have the way
left open to reason his way to what he is willing to
accept as evidence. This is why so many of those
students who sit in the classes of the rationalists in
our colleges and seminaries lose their faith. Rationalism
makes Scriptural faith impossible. Rationalizing
and believing, when the Bible is in question, are
mutually exclusive.</p>

<p>The reason for this is not that the facts of Scripture
contradict each other, and certainly not that these
facts are one thing to faith and another thing to
reason. The antagonism does not arise over the <b>facts</b>
<span class="pgbrk"><a name="png.059" id="png.059"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">59</span><span class="ns">]</span></span>
of the Word but over the <b>interpretation</b> of them. The
rationalist, accepting no interpretation except that
furnished by his own puny and incompetent reason
unillumined by faith, reaches conclusions absolutely
contradicted by those arrived at by the man of faith.
The fact is, he could not hope to arrive anywhere
else. For how can finite man relate and interpret the
few and scattered facts he discovers in the realm of
infinite truth? How can a man by searching find out
God?</p>

<p>&#8220;By whose interpretation, yours or mine?&#8220; is a
favorite question which the rationalist asks the believer
when the meaning of some Scripture passage is in
question. By <b>no one&#8217;s</b> interpretation except the <b>Holy
Spirit&#8217;s</b>! He alone can interpret the Bible, for He
alone knows what He meant by what He wrote. And
even the Holy Spirit is able to interpret the Bible
to <b>no one</b> but the <b>believer</b>. For the rationalist, the
unbeliever, rejects faith, and thereby completely closes
&#8220;the eyes of the heart&#8221; to the illumination of the
Spirit; while the faith of the believer is the very thing
that opens the heart to an understanding of the Word.
Spiritual apprehension begins only at the point where
faith begins.</p>

<p>This is why it is that when the rationalist tries
his hand at interpretation he is sure, sooner or later,
to bring perfectly harmonious facts into confusion
and contradiction.</p>

<p>Take, for example, the facts regarding the development
of the human embryo. The rationalist notes
that as it develops it bears a striking resemblance,
successively, to the more mature forms of some of the
lower animals, in an imagined orderly progress from
<span class="pgbrk"><a name="png.060" id="png.060"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">60</span><span class="ns">]</span></span>
lower to higher. That this resemblance is a fact no
one disputes. There is no controversy over the fact.
But when the rationalist attempts to explain this fact,
he interprets it to mean that man is the product of
evolution, rather than a special creation, as the Bible
says he is, and thus he thrusts such confusion and
contradiction before us that we are compelled to make
a choice between his interpretation and the statements
of the Bible. The controversy that results is
caused altogether by the rationalist thrusting himself
into that place that belongs to the Holy Spirit
alone. &#8220;<b>He</b> shall lead you into all the truth,&#8221; said
Christ, and it is presumptuous in the extreme to seek
to do the Holy Spirit's work for Him.</p>

<p>We are forewarned of the methods of the modern
rationalist in his approach to the Bible by what Christ
said to the Jews who were finding fault with what
He taught:
<span class="bquote">"For had ye believed Moses," He said, "ye
would have believed Me; for he wrote of Me. But
if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe
My words?"</span></p>

<p>This is precisely the pathway modern rationalism has
followed. It began by discrediting what Moses wrote,
and it has now gone to the length of denying final
authority to what Christ said.</p>

<p>Rationalism is both irreverent and destructive when
it seeks to do anything with the Word of God. For
that Book is to be handled as <b>no</b> other book is. Behind
the historical, and the literary, and the textual,
and the philosophical criticism must be a spiritual
discernment, born of faith alone, which both dominates
<span class="pgbrk"><a name="png.061" id="png.061"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">61</span><span class="ns">]</span></span>
and regulates all the rest. For just as a blind man
may turn the eyes of his head to the sun and see no
physical light, so the rationalist may turn the eyes
of his mind to the Bible and see no spiritual truth.
It takes the eyes of the heart to see spiritual truth,
and they can function only through faith.</p>

<p class="s3"><a name="ref.II.II.1.b" id="ref.II.II.1.b"></a><b>b.</b> The Method of the Believer.</p>

<p>In order clearly to understand the method of faith,
we need right here to guard against another extreme.
By the contrasts we have drawn in the last few pages,
it is not at all meant that there is no place in the
exercise of faith for the exercise also of the intellect
at the same time and toward the same object. For,
in the nature of things, the intellect <b>must</b> be exercised
in a mental apprehension of that which is to
be believed before the way is even open for faith to
begin.</p>

<p>Neither is it meant that reasoning is so out of harmony
with and destructive of faith that its exercise
in connection with faith is impossible. For faith is
not blind credulity; it is not jumping in the dark;
it is not an irrational impulse; it is not swallowing
something with the eyes shut. It is rather an open-eyed
stepping out on to the spiritual foundations of
the universe. But notice&mdash;it is stepping out on to
<b>spiritual</b> foundations.</p>

<p>It <b>is</b> meant, however, by the contrasts above, that
the moment an intellectual apprehension of what is
to be believed, followed by a conclusion to accept or
reject it according to whether it is reasonable or not&mdash;the
moment such an attitude is <b>substituted</b> for the
heart acceptance of the bare Word of God, even though
<span class="pgbrk"><a name="png.062" id="png.062"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">62</span><span class="ns">]</span></span>
it may be beyond understanding and reason, that
moment the normal exercise of mind and reason has
degenerated into a rationalism that makes faith impossible.</p>

<p>Notice an emphasis above. Faith is stepping out
upon <b>spiritual</b> foundations. Then recall that to all
except the man of presumption, foundations must be
seen before they will be stepped upon. The normal
man demands to see where he is going.</p>

<p>Now spiritual foundations can be seen only by
spiritual eyes. The natural vision cannot see past
the natural realm. And spiritual realities will never
be stepped out upon until they are seen. For faith
is not an abstract and aimless emotion. It requires
an object that can be seen, and one that can be trusted.</p>

<p>It is therefore the one main purpose of the Bible
to set before men the one saving Object of faith.
This purpose lies behind the multiplied revelations
of God all through the Old Testament, and the gathering
together of all those revelations into Christ in
the New Testament in such fullness and finality that
He could say: &#8220;He that hath seen me hath seen
the Father.&#8221;</p>

<p>But God and Christ must be seen before they can
be trusted. Not intellectually or historically, but
spiritually seen. And they can be seen only by spiritual
eyes. And spiritual vision is possible only through
the divine touch. And the divine touch is given only
to those who consent; it is not forced on any one.
And the attitude of consent is precisely the attitude
set forth in Christ&#8217;s formula: &#8220;If any man wills to
do, he shall know.</p>

<p>Only by coming into this attitude can any man see
<span class="pgbrk"><a name="png.063" id="png.063"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">63</span><span class="ns">]</span></span>
God. &#8220;The pure in <b>heart</b>,&#8221; said Christ, &#8220;shall see
God.&#8221; It is a heart attitude. And the meaning of
the purity of heart that opens the vision to God is
brought out when Christ is asked the question, &#8220;How
is it that Thou wilt manifest Thyself unto us and
not unto the world?&#8221; His answer is of the utmost
significance. He says, &#8220;If a man love Me, he will
<b>keep My words</b>.&#8221; Keeping His words, willing to do
His will&mdash;this is the attitude that opens the vision
to Him. He and the Father can manifest themselves
to and be seen by those only who are in the attitude
of consent toward the keeping of His words. This
is the only attitude that can bring the anointing of
the eyes with that eye-salve which opens them to
spiritual vision.</p>

<p>But when the eyes, in response to this attitude of
willingness toward the will of God, are once opened
to spiritual things, then God, in all the perfections
of His divine character, is seen both in the Bible,
the written Word, and in Christ, the living Word,
and this two-fold revelation of Him is seen to be as
perfect and flawless as the God who is thus revealed.
Those who think they see imperfections either in the
Bible or in Christ are spiritually blind. For when
one thinks he sees flaws where there are only infinite
perfections, he advertises to all that he is attempting
the impossible task of examining spiritual realities
with his natural vision, and is therefore passing judgment
on what he has never seen.</p>

<p>But when the spiritual vision has once been opened,
and God is really seen, in the Bible and in Christ,
in all the perfections of His infinitely holy and loving
character, the <b>reason</b> at once leads to the conclusion
<span class="pgbrk"><a name="png.064" id="png.064"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">64</span><span class="ns">]</span></span>
from the facts seen that such a Being is to be trusted,
and active faith thereby becomes the outgrowth of
<b>that</b> kind of reasoning. That is, the faith that begins
as an attitude of willingness toward the will of
God, through which attitude the eyes are touched
into a vision of the character of God, such a faith
comes into and continues in an active submission to
that will through the normal functioning of reason.</p>

<p>This shows the vital difference between reasoning
and rationalizing, and the relation of each to faith.
The effect of reasoning on faith is constructive, while
that of rationalizing is destructive. And the heart
of the difference between the two traces back, in the
last analysis, to those two kinds of vision. The rationalist,
unyielding to the touch of God on his vision,
sees only natural facts, and even then he sees them
only partially and wholly out of relation to the spiritual
revelation of God in the Bible and in Christ; and
thinking that he sees discrepancies between the facts
in the natural realm and the statements of Scripture,
his <b>reason</b> leads him to reject the Bible as infallible
and inerrant, thereby making faith in the God of the
Bible utterly impossible. His reasoning powers are
simply functioning normally when he concludes to
reject the statements about the facts that to him are
entirely unseen which do not seem to agree with what
he sees. His trouble is not with his reasoning powers
but with his vision. Refusing to see what he is passing
judgment on, his method of inquiry is rationalizing.</p>

<p>But the believer, utterly yielded to God and therefore
seeing Him through anointed eyes in both the
written and the living Word, thus seeing the infinite
perfections of His character, is led by the normal
<span class="pgbrk"><a name="png.065" id="png.065"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">65</span><span class="ns">]</span></span>
functioning of the <b>same reason</b> to accept and act on
the bare Word of God without further evidence, because
the evidence he sees is all the evidence he needs.
It is perfectly reasonable, therefore, for Him to accept
all that such an One says in His Word, waiting
for the partial and apparently contradictory knowledge
in the natural realm to be corrected into harmony
with the Bible. And his reasoning powers are simply
functioning normally when he accepts the Bible as
infallible and inerrant, for this attitude is based on
what he sees. The entire difference between the rationalist
and the believer is a matter of vision. The
reasoning powers of each simply act in view of what
each sees.</p>

<p>This is why reasoning is never out of harmony with
faith, while rationalizing always is. For true reasoning
in spiritual things is <b>based</b> on an attitude of
faith, while rationalizing rejects that attitude as an
essential preliminary to correct conclusions, and therefore
reasons either entirely apart from or in order
to faith. Such an attitude as opens the vision does
not precede the action of reason, and the conclusions
cannot help being destructive of faith, for they are
pronouncements on things utterly unseen and unknown,
and which the Bible says are &#8220;foolishness&#8221;
to the man who sees only through his natural vision.
But the attitude of willingness toward the will of
God so opens the vision to the whole spiritual realm
that the real foolishness is seen to be even the least
attempt to pronounce upon or repudiate that which
is utterly unseen and unknown.</p>

<p>This is the fundamental reason why there is such
divergence, even to the point of mutual exclusion,
<span class="pgbrk"><a name="png.066" id="png.066"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">66</span><span class="ns">]</span></span>
between the different &#8220;interpretations&#8221; of Scripture
given forth by the believer and the rationalist. The
rationalist, with heart and vision closed to spiritual
truth, can give no interpretation except that which
seems reasonable in view of what he sees; while the
believer, in the attitude of faith toward God, <b>sees</b>
the interpretation of Scripture through the illumination
of the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>The interpretation of the Word is the very work
for which the Holy Spirit has come into the world.
That is not all of His work, but a very essential part
of it. He is God&#8217;s official Interpreter of His truth
to the believer. Not to the rationalizer, but to the
believer. And His work is so divinely perfect and
absolutely final that all human attempts at interpretation,
which are devoid of faith, are an insult to Him.
He is the One who wrote the Word, and so He knows
the meaning, not only of what He said, but even of
what He left unsaid, and therefore none but He can
interpret either the words or the silences of Scripture.</p>

<p>For example, when Melchizedek flashes, meteor-like,
across the page of Old Testament history, and
then disappears without a word as to beginning of
life or end of days, who but the Holy Spirit could
interpret those silences into spiritual meanings of unfathomable
richness? Who but He who was responsible
for those omissions could interpret them into
some of the richest revelations of all Scripture concerning
the eternal Priesthood of the slain and risen
Son of God? And if the Holy Spirit can thus seize
upon the very silences of Scripture in showing us
the things of Christ, who will deny Him the power
to interpret to those who will receive it what He
<span class="pgbrk"><a name="png.067" id="png.067"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">67</span><span class="ns">]</span></span>
meant by what He wrote? And who but the rationalist
and the unbeliever can ever refuse to let Him
reveal the perfect harmony between the facts of nature
and the scientific references of Scripture?</p>

<p>It is the divine prerogative to <b>cause</b> us to understand
the Book. When the risen Christ appeared
suddenly among the disciples, first frightened and
then scarcely believing for joy, He first convinced
them that it was really He to whom they had already
given their hearts, thus quickening their <b>faith</b> into
renewed activity, &#8220;Then opened <b>He</b> their <b>mind</b> that
they might <b>understand</b> the Scriptures.&#8221; First faith
and then knowledge of the truth; this is the scientific
order.</p>

<p>Luther saw this when he wrote to Spalatin:
<span class="bquote">Above all things it is quite true that one cannot
search into the Holy Scriptures by means of
study, nor by means of the intellect. Therefore
begin with prayer that the Lord grant unto you
the true understanding of His Word.</span></p>

<p>Even Spencer had a glimpse of this scientific principle
toward the end of his life. In his essay on &#8220;Feeling
Versus Intellect&#8221; he showed that he had lost
faith in his former estimate of the place of the intellect
in the moral realm when he said:
<span class="bquote">Everywhere the cry is educate&mdash;educate&mdash;educate!
Everywhere the belief is that by such culture
as schools furnish, children, and therefore
adults, can be molded into the desired shapes.
It is assumed that when men are taught what is
right, they will do what is right&mdash;that a proposition
intellectually accepted becomes morally operative.
And this conviction, contradicted by
<span class="pgbrk"><a name="png.068" id="png.068"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">68</span><span class="ns">]</span></span>
everyday experience, is at variance with an everyday
axiom&mdash;the axiom that each faculty is
strengthened by the exercise of it&mdash;intellectual
power by intellectual action, and moral power by
moral action.</span></p>

<p>What can this mean but that Spencer saw, at least
dimly, the radical difference between the intellectual
and the spiritual faculties?</p>

<p>The logic of all these facts and principles makes
only one conclusion possible. When the man of scientific
spirit approaches the Book which can reveal its
truths to <b>faith alone</b>, he will not be unscientific enough
to refuse faith to its statements and use his <b>intellect</b>
alone. For he will see that the one who refuses the
attitude of faith toward the Scriptures will be &#8220;ever
learning and never able to come to a knowledge of
the truth,&#8221; while the one who accepts the Word in
humble dependence on the Holy Spirit&#8217;s interpretation
of its meaning is on the one solitary highway
by which a knowledge of the truth can be reached.
When the Church and the Schools, therefore, agree on
using this method of approach to the Word of God,
they will at least have started toward the same goal.</p>

<h4 class="s2"><a name="ref.II.II.2" id="ref.II.II.2"></a>2. The <b>Spiritual</b> Realm Must Be Given Primacy over
the <b>Natural</b>.</h4>

<p>Let us now see what it will mean to accord primacy
to the spiritual realm over the natural.</p>

<p>There is only one possible method of doing this,
and that is to interpret in the light of spiritual truth
all the facts of the natural realm.</p>

<p>The man of scientific mind will therefore see clearly
that he will be utterly incapable of giving such an
<span class="pgbrk"><a name="png.069" id="png.069"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">69</span><span class="ns">]</span></span>
interpretation to natural facts until he first <b>knows
what spiritual truth is</b>, and this will mean the laboratory
method of the experiment of faith.</p>

<p>But right here you may say that science has nothing
to do with the spiritual realm; that scientific investigation
stops the moment it reaches that realm; and
that therefore to demand the use of these scientific
methods in that realm is not only foolish but impossible.</p>

<p>But stop and think a minute. It is both foolish
and futile to demand that either the <b>implements</b> or
the <b>faculties</b> used in the scientific realm shall be
brought over and used in the pursuit of spiritual
truth. This is precisely the thing we are seeking to
show. But that does not mean for a moment that the
inquirer must therefore give up the <b>scientific attitude
of mind</b> and cease to work according to the demands
of the <b>scientific spirit</b> the moment he begins inquiry
in the spiritual realm. For that spirit is simply an
honest and accurate method of investigation, and because
science is compelled to stop at the border of
the spiritual realm is no reason why we should cease
being honest and accurate when we investigate in that
realm. It is perfectly true that the scientist, as such,
has absolutely no pronouncement to make concerning
spiritual truth; but it is equally true that the
inquirer in the spiritual realm, if he does not pursue
his inquiries by scientific methods and according to
the demands of the scientific spirit, will have no pronouncement
to make either. The man who intends,
therefore, to be scientific enough in his spirit to give
primary truth its place of primacy by interpreting in
its light the truths of other realms, and who, with
<span class="pgbrk"><a name="png.070" id="png.070"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">70</span><span class="ns">]</span></span>
the instincts of the true scientist, recognizes spiritual
truth as primary in its relation to the natural, will
be actuated sufficiently by his scientific attitude to
determine to know what spiritual truth is, in order
that he may be able to interpret natural truth in its
light.</p>

<p>This will bring him face to face with Christ&#8217;s formula
for entering upon the knowledge of spiritual
truth. Being honestly desirous of knowing what
spiritual truth is, he will determine to do God&#8217;s will
in order that he may find out.</p>

<p class="s3"><a name="ref.II.II.2.a" id="ref.II.II.2.a"></a><b>a.</b> This Will Mean Surrendering the Heart to God.</p>

<p>This is the only thing it can mean. For spiritual
truth is primarily heart truth, not intellectual truth,
and the only way to know heart truth is to surrender
the heart to that Holy Spirit of truth who &#8220;searcheth
the deep things of God,&#8221; and who was sent into the
world to &#8220;lead us into all the truth.&#8221;</p>

<p>The grammarian, the philologist, the historian, the
naturalist, the philosopher, therefore, have no service
they can perform here. They cannot carry their apparatus
over into the spiritual realm and weigh and
measure, estimate and judge, illumine and interpret
spiritual truth for us. When we stand here we are
on that holy ground where we must lay off our sandals
of scientific paraphernalia and stand before God with
open heart ready to hear what He has to say. The
moment we get to this realm, the whole apparatus
by which truth is received changes from reason to
faith.</p>

<p>But do you see where this brings us? Straight back
<span class="pgbrk"><a name="png.071" id="png.071"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">71</span><span class="ns">]</span></span>
to Christ&#8217;s formula! This is precisely what His formula
involves, for when a man wills to do God's will,
he takes the first step in faith.</p>

<p>Then when a man comes into this attitude toward
God's will, he will next inquire where he is to commence
in the doing of that will, what the first step
is in the will of God.</p>

<p>The Textbook tells us that the first step is to &#8220;repent
and believe the Gospel.&#8221; That this is the first
step is self-evident, because the heart must be opened
to Him who alone can give the knowledge of spiritual
truth before that knowledge is possible, and repentance
and faith are the opening of the heart to Him.
For repentance is a coming into that attitude of heart
toward God in which the whole life is laid bare before
Him exactly as it is, thereby opening the way for
faith; and believing the Gospel is an entering upon
that faith which accepts the Gospel&mdash;the Good News&mdash;of
Christ&#8217;s finished work of atonement for sin
through His shed blood on the cross, and reckons
pardon for sin and new life in Christ to be now ours
according to the Word of God. For faith, you remember,
is both an attitude and an act; an attitude
of surrender to God, and an act of receiving what
God has for us; and this is precisely what it means
to repent and believe the Gospel.</p>

<p>This means that the man of genuine scientific spirit
will begin his pursuit of spiritual truth by sincere
&#8220;repentance toward God&#8221; and &#8220;faith toward our
Lord Jesus Christ&#8221; for salvation through His shed
blood, which, according to the Textbook, are the first
steps in willing to do the will of God, followed by a
moment-by-moment dependence on Christ, Who is now
<span class="pgbrk"><a name="png.072" id="png.072"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">72</span><span class="ns">]</span></span>
his life, to reveal truth to him as he continues, by
faith, in the attitude of an open heart. This is the
only possible way of ever knowing that truth which
alone can make us free.</p>

<p>It is true that it is quite the fashion these days for
every unbeliever, agnostic, modernist, and unitarian
to quote those words of Christ &#8220;Ye shall know the
truth, and the truth shall make you free&#8221; in justification
of the claim that something which he is pleased
to call truth has given him what he fancies is freedom.
But Scripture could not be more grossly perverted
than by such a wresting of its plain meaning.
The whole statement reads:
<span class="bquote">Then said Jesus unto <b>those</b> Jews that <b>believed</b>
on <b>Him</b>, if <b>ye continue</b> in <b>My Word</b>, <b>then</b> are ye
My disciples indeed; and <b>ye</b> shall <b>know</b> the truth,
and the truth shall make you free.</span></p>

<p>Only the spiritually blind can fail to see the meaning
of such a statement. It plainly means that the
first step toward freedom is <b>faith in Christ</b>, the genuineness
of which is evidenced by <b>continuance in His
Word</b>; and that it is only in this attitude of <b>faith</b> that
it is possible to <b>know</b> the truth that makes us free.</p>

<p>The truth is, therefore, that to be free one must
believe on Christ. This does not mean to give intellectual
assent to this or that fact about Him, but
utterly to commit the life to Him, sin and all, past,
present, and future. For the Gospel tells us not so
much what to believe as Whom to believe, and Paul
tells us what faith in Christ means when he exclaims:
&#8220;I know <b>Whom</b> I have believed,&#8221; and then further
unfolds what this involves by adding, &#8220;and am persuaded
<span class="pgbrk"><a name="png.073" id="png.073"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">73</span><span class="ns">]</span></span>
that He is able to keep that which I have
<b>committed unto Him</b> against that day.&#8220;</p>

<p>Faith is not simply giving mental assent to facts,
it is primarily surrendering to a Person. This is
what it means to believe on Christ, and anything short
of this will neither give us knowledge of the truth
nor make us free.</p>

<p>Then following this attitude toward Christ, the
believer evidences his faith by continuing in His Word,
by which he comes into experiential knowledge of its
truth and its meaning.</p>

<p>Then coming to know the truth by experiencing it
through faith, he is where the Son of God Himself
becomes his freedom. And there is no other freedom.
It is in the experience of <b>Himself</b>, not in an
intellectual assent to facts about Him, that He makes
us free by becoming the <b>way</b> to God for us, the <b>truth</b>
about God to us, and the <b>life</b> of God in us.</p>

<p>It is therefore only he whom the Son sets free who
is free indeed, for freedom from the curse of sin by
the experience of Christ as Saviour, and freedom
from the blindness of error by the experience of Christ
as Truth incarnate, is the only freedom there is.</p>

<p>When the Word says, therefore, &#8220;Whatsoever is not
of <b>faith</b> is <b>sin</b>,&#8221; it contemplates both the object of
faith and the cause of forfeited freedom. For the
Holy Spirit came to convict men of <b>sin</b> because they
<b>believe not on Christ</b>. Unfaith in Christ is therefore
the essence of sin. And sin is bondage, not freedom.
Scripture describes the unbeliever in Christ as the
bondslave of sin, held in chains of darkness and error.
This is why it is impossible either to know even natural
truth in any adequate way, or to be able to untangle
<span class="pgbrk"><a name="png.074" id="png.074"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">74</span><span class="ns">]</span></span>
it from error, without becoming a believer on Christ
as the first step. So let no one who has not surrendered
his heart to Christ in faith boast that he either
knows the truth or is free.</p>

<p>But suppose a man should seek to know spiritual
truth and yet refuse to surrender his heart to Christ
in faith, then what? It could only be because he was
so devoid of the scientific spirit that he did not want
to <b>know the truth</b> at <b>any cost</b>. And no man who is
in this frame of mind can ever come to know the
truth. Haeckel defines the scientific attitude of mind
when he says of the scientific inquirer that his
<span class="bquote">sole and only task is to seek to know the truth,
and to teach what he has discovered to be the
truth, indifferent as to ... consequences.</span></p>

<p>This means, in the terms of our present discussion,
that in order to know spiritual truth, the man of
scientific mind will be willing to work by Christ's
formula no matter what it costs him, for that alone
will give him the knowledge of eternal things which
will make it possible adequately to interpret natural
truth.</p>

<p>But suppose the inquirer doubts the possibility of
entering into a scientific knowledge of spiritual truth
by following this formula, what then? It can only
be because he is so unscholarly as to make the blunder
in logic of assuming as untrue or impossible that
which <b>remains to be proved</b>.</p>

<p>No matter on which ground he refuses to surrender
to Christ, therefore, no inquirer after spiritual truth
can be either scientific or scholarly who makes this
refusal; for he thereby renders himself not only utterly
<span class="pgbrk"><a name="png.075" id="png.075"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">75</span><span class="ns">]</span></span>
incompetent to know spiritual truth, but also
entirely unable to accord primacy to the spiritual
realm by interpreting natural truth in its light.</p>

<p>Suppose a man should take this attitude of indifference
or unbelief toward natural truth. Suppose
that after refusing to make the first experiment in
the study of chemistry he should attempt researches
in a realm whose facts required interpretation in the
light of the chemical laws he had refused to learn
in the laboratory. Then suppose he should dogmatically
announce such interpretations of his discoveries
in that realm as were altogether out of harmony with
the most fundamental laws in the chemical realm.
And then suppose that in order to maintain his unfounded
and arbitrary interpretations he should so
twist the statements of the textbook on chemistry
into harmony with his theories as to destroy their
essential integrity. He would win nothing but contempt
from experienced chemists. He would certainly
find no place in the ranks of scientists.</p>

<p>This is precisely why evolutionists and rationalists,
using this method exactly, can win no response from
experienced Christians, and why they ought to be
outside the membership of our churches as long as
they pursue this method. Believers can not listen for
one moment to such interpretations of scientific facts
by unbelievers as destroy the essential doctrines of
the Christian faith and deny the inerrancy and final
authority of the Word of God. For unbelievers have
not only not secured a scientific knowledge of what
they are talking about, but they have not even acquired
the right to <b>pass an opinion</b> on the fundamental
doctrines of the Bible. How can they announce dogmatically
<span class="pgbrk"><a name="png.076" id="png.076"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">76</span><span class="ns">]</span></span>
so-called scientific interpretations of the
facts of nature which give the lie to the unmistakable
doctrines of the spiritual Textbook whose truthfulness
they have refused to put to the laboratory
test of experience, and yet at the same time claim
to be actuated by the scientific spirit? Those who do
such things know nothing about the scientific spirit!
Canon Dyson Hague was scientifically correct when he
said that the rationalists are being opposed, not on
the ground of their scholarship, but
<span class="bquote">because the biblical criticism of rationalists and
unbelievers can be neither expert nor scientific.</span></p>

<p>There is but one conclusion possible. The man who
intends to accord primacy to the spiritual realm will
first acquire a verified knowledge of spiritual truth
by the laboratory method of experience, according to
the formula of the Textbook. For when he does this
he will then be qualified to take the next step and
make the primacy of spiritual truth an actual reality.</p>

<p class="s3"><a name="ref.II.II.2.b" id="ref.II.II.2.b"></a><b>b.</b> This will Mean Interpreting Natural Truth in the
Light of the Bible.</p>

<p>We have now arrived at that point where we can
sum up the logic of the scientific method of the laboratory
as it applies to the investigation of the theory
of evolution.</p>

<p>The man who is honest enough to want to know
the truth at all cost, and accurate enough to insist
on coming into a knowledge of the truth both by
scientific methods and in the scientific order of primacy,
will first acquire an adequate knowledge by
experience, as we have already decided, of those statements
<span class="pgbrk"><a name="png.077" id="png.077"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">77</span><span class="ns">]</span></span>
of the Bible that can be verified to the experience,
and then he will for the first time be qualified
to arrive at an adequate estimate of the statements
that cannot be so verified.</p>

<p>Then recognizing that all the scientific references of
the Bible, including those relating to origins, are in
that class that can not be verified to the experience,
he will decide to come to no conclusions concerning
them except such as will maintain both the primacy
of primary truth and the unity of all the realms of
truth. He will do this because it is the only thing
he can do and still maintain a truly scientific attitude
of mind.</p>

<p>This will mean that he will interpret all the non-experimental
statements of the Bible, including the
scientific references, in harmony with and in the light
of those spiritual and experiential truths which he
has already had verified to him through his own personal
relations with God through faith in Christ. In
other words, he will maintain the primacy of spiritual
truth by allowing no interpretation of scientific facts
that will cast either denial or doubt on those fundamental
doctrines which he now <b>knows</b> are true, because
they have been <b>supernaturally verified</b> to him
through the laboratory test of faith.</p>

<p>Take an illustration. Suppose an author on chemistry,
who was also a historian, should include in
his textbook a history of the science of chemistry.
Now if a man puts his statements of chemical laws
to an accurate laboratory test and finds them true,
he has the presumption established that the history,
which cannot be so tested, is also true.</p>

<p><span class="pgbrk"><a name="png.078" id="png.078"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">78</span><span class="ns">]</span></span>
Yes, that illustration breaks down, but only at the
point of <b>human fallibility</b> and <b>imperfection</b>. If that
author were omniscient and infallible the illustration
would be perfect.</p>

<p>Now apply it to the Word. When a man, through
the unfailing laboratory test of honest faith, finds
that the statements that can be put to the test of
experience are infallible truth, he has not simply the
presumption but also the <b>absolute certainty</b> established
that all its other statements are true, because the
infallible and omniscient Author has given it to us
as His Word. It comes to us with a &#8220;Thus saith the
Lord&#8221; ringing in our ears from beginning to end,
and not with the multiplied repetitions of &#8220;We may
well suppose&#8221; of the scientific guessers.</p>

<p>The man of scientific mind, therefore, will accept
all the non-experiential statements of the Bible as
infallible truth, including scientific and historical references
and prophetic utterances. He will then accord
the place of primacy to all understood scientific references
of the Bible over all discoveries in the natural
realm. He will do this by interpreting the few and
fragmentary discoveries of finite and fallible man in
the light of the statements that come to us as the
Word of an infallible God, concluding that if there
is any apparent inharmony, it lies in the partial discoveries
or premature conclusions of scientists, rather
than in any error of statement in the Bible. In other
words, he will interpret science in the light of the
Bible, and not the Bible in the light of science. And
if at any time a harmonizing of scientific discoveries
with the Bible seems impossible, he will withhold
final conclusions until he has further scientific light,
<span class="pgbrk"><a name="png.079" id="png.079"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">79</span><span class="ns">]</span></span>
realizing that when he knows enough science he will
then be able to understand the scientific references
of the Bible, and the apparent inharmony will vanish.
Multiplied illustrations of this are so familiar that
it is scarcely necessary to elaborate on it, as many
will occur to the reader who is at all familiar with
the essential harmony between the Bible and all real
scientific knowledge, and with the fact that a multitude
of scientific discoveries have been made, only to
find that the Bible made reference to them in the
most accurate scientific terms many centuries before
their discovery.</p>

<p>A conclusion is now possible as to what attitude
a man who has faith in an inerrant Bible will be compelled
to take toward the theory of evolution. When
he sees that the logic of evolution destroys every
fundamental Scripture doctrine which he has already
had verified to him by the Holy Spirit; when he learns
that evolution is not only entirely unproven but even
discredited by many competent men of science; and
when he turns to the Bible and reads the statement
repeated over and again that each species was created
to reproduce only &#8220;after his kind&#8221;; he will be compelled
to make a choice between evolution and an
inerrant Bible, and, believing the Bible, he will reject
evolution.</p>

<p>Then when he recalls that to Eve, Satan advanced
an unproven theory which assumed to interpret, but
had the effect of denying, the Word of God, and then
reflects that the theory of evolution does precisely
the same thing, he will become suspicious that the
&#8220;father of lies&#8221; is behind the whole evolutionary
propaganda. Other theories that are unproven and
<span class="pgbrk"><a name="png.080" id="png.080"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">80</span><span class="ns">]</span></span>
discredited fall by their own weight. The persistence
of this theory must be accounted for on the ground
that it can be used to destroy faith in the infallibility
of the Bible.</p>

<p>It is quite true that there are many who say they
believe the Bible and accept evolution also. But how
those who are mentally sound and capable of logical
consistency can accept two mutually exclusive propositions
at the same time, it is impossible to understand.
We will be compelled to let those who say
they accept both the Bible and evolution explain how
they do it&mdash;if they can! But meantime, if we take
pains to make careful inquiry of such people, we
shall find that in <b>every case</b> where logical and consistent
thinking has any meaning whatever, a <b>choice</b>
has been made between the Bible as an inerrant and
infallible Book and the theory of evolution. It is
quite possible for a man to hold the &#8220;scientific&#8221; or
&#8220;historical&#8221; attitude toward the Bible, which makes
it a human book marred by many errors, and believe
in evolution at the same time; but the man who holds
that attitude toward the Bible <b>does not believe it at
all</b>! No one can accept the theory of evolution and
the doctrine of an inerrant Bible at the same time.</p>

<p>And yet the attempt is being very skilfully made by
many leaders in the Schools today to camouflage this
impossibility. A very recent article by Dr. Shailer
Mathews on &#8220;Christ and Education&#8221; is a typical
illustration.</p>

<p>In the midst of the article Dr. Mathews frankly
indicates his acceptance of evolution, because of which,
he says, &#8220;the meaning of religion was enlarged&#8221; for
him. Then he leaves the impression with the reader
<span class="pgbrk"><a name="png.081" id="png.081"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">81</span><span class="ns">]</span></span>
that the conclusions of modern science are to be taken
without question, and also that our faith in Christ
and the Bible are to be brought into harmony with
these conclusions. That is, our faith must combine
an acceptance of evolution with whatever attitude
toward Christ and the Scriptures the evolutionary
philosophy makes possible. This puts reason above
Revelation and makes the scientific realm primary
in its relation to the spiritual. The reader can judge,
in the light of our previous thinking, whether this
procedure is scientific or not.</p>

<p>Then in speaking of the fact that the educated
man as truly as the ignorant man needs the saving
power of Christ, he says:
<span class="bquote">But he must be saved as an educated man and
not as an ignorant man. He cannot be forced to
give up what he knows to be real. If he be told
that Christian loyalty involves the abandonment
of the assured results and methods of scientific
investigation, he will refuse such loyalty.</span></p>

<p>This implied charge is later on in the article made
specific when he says that some schools
<span class="bquote">"are refusing to let their students know the results
of scientific investigation for fear lest such knowledge
will ruin certain theological beliefs for which
the schools stand"&mdash;a method he describes as putting
a premium upon ignorance as a prerequisite
for faith.</span></p>

<p>The reader knows as well as the writer that the
whole attitude of the Christian Church, and therefore
of true Christian education, challenges those
words and hurls them back at their author for proof.
<span class="pgbrk"><a name="png.082" id="png.082"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">82</span><span class="ns">]</span></span>
Both the implied and the direct accusations are utterly
without foundation. Indeed, the thing Dr. Mathews
charges is the one thing true Christian education does
<b>not</b> do.</p>

<p>When did the Church ever try to force a man, educated
or ignorant, to give up what he knows to be
facts in order to become a Christian? When was a
man ever asked by Christian schools to choose between
the assured results and methods of scientific investigation
and loyalty to Christ? When has that institution
which, above all others, has fought ignorance
and fostered true scientific investigation used a method
that put a premium on ignorance as a prerequisite
for faith?</p>

<p>It is not <b>facts</b> that the Church either fears or refuses
to accept, but such an <b>interpretation</b> of them by
evolutionists and rationalists as to deny the scientific
accuracy and therefore the inerrancy of the Word of
God. It is altogether beside the truth to intimate
that the Church is fostering an education that has to
withhold assured scientific facts for fear their knowledge
would ruin faith in any theological beliefs whatever
&#8220;for which the schools stand.&#8221; It is not the <b>knowledge</b>
of scientific facts that true Christian schools
ever withhold, but such <b>theories</b> and <b>speculations</b> concerning
their meaning as would destroy the schools
as Christian institutions if the logic of them were
followed to the end. And as for the Church ever
abandoning the assured results and methods of scientific
investigation, this is precisely the thing the Church
is <b>fighting to maintain</b> against the efforts of evolutionists
and rationalists. It is rather the <b>Schools</b> that
have been abandoning scientific methods of investigation,
<span class="pgbrk"><a name="png.083" id="png.083"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">83</span><span class="ns">]</span></span>
thereby reaching &#8220;assured results&#8221; that invalidate
not only the doctrine of an inerrant Bible, but
every other fundamental doctrine of the Scriptures.
Indeed, this is the very reason why the controversy
between the Church and the Schools is now on, and
Dr. Mathews&#8217; article is typical of the attempts that
are being made to make it appear that faith in evolution
and the Bible can be combined&mdash;an attempt toward
which all believers in an infallible Book will
always be irreconcilable.</p>

<p>And this irreconcilable attitude is not without reason,
but for the perfectly valid reason that the one
who accepts evolution as a fact is utterly unscientific.
For in the first place he accepts unproven assumptions
and rationalistic speculations as demonstrated facts.
And, in the next place, he thereby forces human interpretations
of scientific facts to contradict the divinely
verified doctrines of the Bible, thus thrusting confusion
and contradiction between realms of truth which are
in perfect harmony. And, still further, he interprets
the Bible in the light(?) not simply of science but
even of a false science, and thus compels unproven
hypotheses to deny the truthfulness of the scientific
and historical references of the Bible, thereby forcing
into primacy a realm of truth that is not primary.
And all of this because he refuses to follow
the formula of the spiritual Textbook and put faith
above reason and the Bible above science in his approach
to truth. How can a man follow such methods
and yet imagine that he is scientific?</p>

<p>One more thing remains to be said before this argument
is completed. We started out with an unproven,
though self-evident premise. Turn back to the very
<span class="pgbrk"><a name="png.084" id="png.084"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">84</span><span class="ns">]</span></span>
first paragraph in the book and you will find that
the falsity of the pantheistic theory was assumed
but not proved. Its falsity was assumed on grounds
that have come to light as the argument has proceeded,
and that might easily be turned to account
now as conclusive proofs. For example, to refer to
one of them, the self-evident distinction between the
realm which contains the Creator and that which
contains His creation science proves to be a real
divergence in kind by being compelled to cease investigation
with scientific apparatus the moment the
boundary line of the spiritual realm is reached. And
if there is as real a distinction between God and His
creation as this indicates, the doctrines of pantheism
are impossible.</p>

<p>But the theory of evolution fosters a doctrine of
the &#8220;immanence of God&#8221; which is nothing but a
modern form of pantheism. For example, Prof. Josiah
Royce, of Harvard, has said:
<span class="bquote">God is the spirit animating nature, the universal
force which takes the myriad forms, heat, light,
gravitation, electricity, and the like.</span></p>

<p>And Prof. George B. Foster said:
<span class="bquote">God is a symbol to designate the universe in
its ideal achieving capacity.</span></p>

<p>This is pantheism, pure and simple, for God and
His created universe are not distinguished from each
other. And this blots out the distinction between the
natural and the spiritual realms.</p>

<p>Realizing, therefore, that no matter how perfect
a course of reasoning may be or how inevitable the
<span class="pgbrk"><a name="png.085" id="png.085"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">85</span><span class="ns">]</span></span>
conclusions resulting it all falls like a house of cards
if the premise is false, it becomes necessary to determine
whether pantheism is false or true, in order
that we may know whether we started with a valid
premise.</p>

<p>Is pantheism true?</p>

<p>One thing we know is true. The Bible clearly and
sharply distinguishes between God and His creation.
No one who reads the Bible can dissent from that
statement. And pantheism absolutely denies that
Bible distinction.</p>

<p>It therefore immediately resolves itself into a question
as to whether the Bible is true.</p>

<p>This brings us straight back to Christ&#8217;s formula&mdash;&#8220;If
any man wills to do, he shall know.&#8221; He who
accepts the challenge of this formula will come to
know, beyond all possibility of disproof, that neither
pantheism, evolution, nor any other doctrine that
denies or casts doubt on the infallibility of the Bible
is true. He will know it because it is supernaturally
verified to him in answer to his faith.</p>

<p>This formula is the divine challenge to every form
of unbelief in an inerrant Bible. There never has
been an hour since Pentecost when the aggressive
hurling of this challenge at defiant and destructive
unbelief was more needed. And the whole Christian
Church, backed by the Word of God, is hurling this
challenge back into the teeth of the whole evolutionary
camp today.</p>

<p>Either be fair enough, be scientific enough, be honest
enough, challenges the Church, to act upon Christ&#8217;s
formula and gain for yourselves that supernaturally
verified knowledge which will make further faith in
<span class="pgbrk"><a name="png.086" id="png.086"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">86</span><span class="ns">]</span></span>
the evolutionary theory impossible, or else do not
assume to pronounce any further on those truths of
which you know nothing because you have been unwilling
to take the means to find out what they are.
Go and join the ranks of the other unbelievers and
Bible-rejectors, taking your doubt-born theories with
you as a reinforcement to their warfare against the
Bible, and then the Church can fight you in the open
and drive you to defeat with the Sword of the Spirit,
which is the Word of God. If you are determined
to destroy faith in the inerrancy of the Bible, at least
be fair enough to come out from under the cover of
&#8220;Christian education,&#8221; and stop assuming to interpret
in the light of evolution&mdash;a light that is darkness&mdash;those
sublime doctrines which are at once the foundation
and the message of the Church. Get out of the
Christian schools, which were founded to strengthen,
not to destroy, the faith of young people from Christian
homes, and give place to those who believe the
Book. Increasing hosts of Christian parents are too
heart-broken over the invasion of their own homes
by this destroying wolf in sheep&#8217;s clothing to tolerate
this situation much longer. They are asking, in the
words of a Chicago newspaper editorial concerning
the destructive teachings of Prof. George B. Foster,
in the Chicago University Divinity School:
<span class="bquote">Is there no place to assail Christianity but a
divinity school? Is there no one to write infidel
books except the professors of Christian theology?
Is a theological seminary an appropriate place
for a general massacre of Christian doctrine?</span></p>

<p>And then the sentiment that follows in the next sentence
<span class="pgbrk"><a name="png.087" id="png.087"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">87</span><span class="ns">]</span></span>
is shared increasingly by multitudes in the
Church in proportion as these destroyers become increasingly
aggressive in their work of destruction.
The editor continues:
<span class="bquote">Mr. Mangasarian delivers infidel lectures every
Sunday in Orchestra Hall and no one is shocked,
but when the professed defenders of Christianity
jump on it and assassinate it, the public&mdash;even the
agnostic public, cannot but despise them.</span></p>

<p>Either be scientific enough, cry believers to the evolutionists,
to accept the challenge of Christ&#8217;s formula
with all its implications, or be honest enough to cease
destroying the faith in an inerrant Bible you have
sworn to defend but refuse to accept!</p>

<p>The Church is also hurling the challenge of Christ&#8217;s
formula at every other form of aggressive unbelief.
No unbeliever, from destructive Higher Critic to agnostic
and infidel, has the shadow of a right to make
contrary pronouncement on the inerrancy and infallible
authority of the Bible, for he has refused to put
Christ&#8217;s word to the test,&mdash;his unbelief proves it,&mdash;and
he is therefore utterly incapacitated for passing
any judgment whatever on that Book which unfolds
its meaning to faith alone.</p>

<p>And as to the controversy between the Church
and the Schools, the evolutionists must quit either
evolution or the Christian schools, or the controversy
can in no way be cured. For how can faith in an
inerrant Bible and unbelief in its inerrancy abide
in harmony in the same house? In the very nature
of things, two groups who hold such absolutely antagonistic
positions must either part company or continue
<span class="pgbrk"><a name="png.088" id="png.088"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">88</span><span class="ns">]</span></span>
the controversy born of the antagonism. The
true Church always has believed, and always will
believe, in an inerrant Word of God, and she cannot
harbor within her ranks any group of people, no matter
by what name they go, who do not take their
stand without equivocation on that same ground.</p>

<p>If reason for this intolerance is asked, it will appear
in the light of some questions asked by Dr. Joseph
Parker. These questions are:
<span class="bquote">If the Bible is wrong in history, what guarantee
is there that it is right in morals?</span>

<span>If the Bible is not a reliable guide in facts, how
do we know that it is a trustworthy guide in doctrine?</span></p>

<p>However he may have arrived at his conclusions,
it is extremely significant, in the light of these questions,
that Dr. E. D. Burton, being willing to admit
that the Bible is
<span class="bquote">not infallible in history or in matters of science,</span>
has also concluded that it is
<span class="bquote">not wholly consistent and therefore not ultimately
and as a whole inerrant in the field of morals
and <a name="tn2" id="tn2"></a><ins class="TNsilent" title="This period was added.">religion.</ins></span></p>

<p>What reason more can the Church want to justify
her for intolerance of a theory that will do this to
a man&#8217;s faith? Is it not correct reasoning to conclude
that if one man suffers such a collapse of faith
after accepting evolution, others are likely to suffer
the same thing? And when the Church observes this
<span class="pgbrk"><a name="png.089" id="png.089"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">89</span><span class="ns">]</span></span>
collapse taking place in every quarter, and then discovers
that back of it lies the theory of evolution,
is she not justified for being intolerant of that thing
which is gnawing at the vitals of her faith? What
can she say else than that the teachers of evolution,
at least in the Christian schools, must either give up
evolution and come back to faith in an infallible Bible,
or part company with the Church?</p>

<p>It may be that one reason why the evolutionists are
so loth to get out of company they do not belong in
is because they fear that thereby they may lose their
coveted reputation for scholarship. Prof. Howard W.
Kellogg, formerly of Occidental College, hints as much
when he says:
<span class="bquote">Science has again and again set aside as untrustworthy
the so-called discoveries of evolution, has
compelled the great German evolutionist, Haeckel,
to confess that his drawings of missing links were
from imagination rather than from objects found,
has driven him from his university chair, and has
compelled him to admit that "Most modern investigators
of science have come to the conclusion
that the doctrine of evolution, and particularly of
Darwinism, is in error and cannot be maintained,"&mdash;and
yet in spite of such admissions from men
recognized as authorities in their respective lines,
the doctrine of evolution appears to rule as absolutely
in the educational world as if it were not
a moribund hypothesis, already discarded by
many, and to be discarded by others when scientific
evidence rather than reputation for scholarship
is allowed the deciding voice.</span></p>

<p>But whatever the actuating motive may be that has
kept the evolutionists from giving up their unscholarly
<span class="pgbrk"><a name="png.090" id="png.090"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">90</span><span class="ns">]</span></span>
and unscientific theory, true believers in the Word long
to see them do what Henry Drummond, that brilliant
scientist, did before he died. On his deathbed he
said to Sir William Dawson, as reported in this country
in the writer's hearing by Dr. John Robertson
directly from the lips of Dawson:
<span class="bquote">I am going away back to the Book to believe it
and receive it as I did at the first. I can live no
longer on uncertainties. I am going back to the
faith of the Word of God.</span></p>

<p>When both the Church and the Schools consistently
and sincerely take this attitude toward the Bible, the
controversy will be ended in the one way in which
the Church longs to see it end.</p>
